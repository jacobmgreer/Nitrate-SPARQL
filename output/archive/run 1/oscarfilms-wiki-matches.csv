The screenplay by [[Hanns Kräly]] is based on the 1925 [[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Frederick Lonsdale]] which ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for 385 performances.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=9942 ''The Last of Mrs. Cheyney''] on [[IBDB.com]]</ref> The film was remade twice, [[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|with the same title]] in 1937 and as ''[[The Law and the Lady (1951 film)|The Law and the Lady]]'' in 1951. The film's sets were designed by the resident [[MGM]] [[art director]] [[Cedric Gibbons]]. ==Plot== Resourceful and engaging Fay Cheyney, posing as a wealthy [[Australia]]n widow at a [[Monte Carlo]] hotel, befriends Mrs. Webley with the intention of stealing her pearl necklace, a plot devised by Charles, her butler and partner-in-crime. Complicating the situation are the romantic feelings she develops for Lord Arthur Dilling, Mrs. Webley's nephew. While taking the necklace during a party in the Webley home, Fay is caught by Arthur, who threatens to expose her unless she submits to him. Rather than compromise her principles, she confesses to her hostess, who plans to contact the police until Lord Elton, another guest, recalls Fay has a love letter he wrote her that could prove to be embarrassing to everyone present. They offer her money in exchange for the letter and her freedom, but when she destroys the letter and refuses their payment, they welcome her back into their social circle. ==Cast== *[[Norma Shearer]] as Fay Cheyney *[[Basil Rathbone]] as Lord Arthur Dilling *[[George Barraud]] as Charles *[[Herbert Bunston]] as Lord Elton *[[Hedda Hopper]] as Lady Maria *[[Maude Turner Gordon]] as Mrs. Webley * Moon Carroll as Joan * Madeline Seymour as Mrs. Wynton * [[Cyril Chadwick]] as Willie Wynton * [[George K. Arthur]] as George * Frank Finch Smiles as William ==Critical reception== [[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, ""It is a well-arranged picture, but nevertheless one in which it is not difficult to detect where Mr. Lonsdale left off and where the scenario writers tried their hand at dialogue . . . There are a number of interesting dramatic passages that are pictured with considerable cunning. The dialogue goes on for some time, and Sidney Franklin, the director, keeps his players busy, which is a relief after seeing talking screen images standing in the same spot until they have had their say.""<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9504E6D81E30E33ABC4A52DFBE668382639EDE ''New York Times'' review]</ref> Edwin Schallert of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' observed, ""In the portrayals, Miss Shearer averaged well. She evidences a more precise expressiveness facially than she does vocally, and some of her very best scenes are in the silent ones. Nevertheless, she measures very well to the majority of the role’s requirements, the crispness of her voice being well suited to the repartee portions. She is exceedingly attractive in the role.""<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hollywood-legends.webs.com/ladyofthenight/thelastof.htm# |title=''The Last of Mrs. Cheyney'' at HollywoodLegends.webs.com |access-date=April 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011083721/http://hollywood-legends.webs.com/ladyofthenight/thelastof.htm# |archive-date=October 11, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ==Awards and honors== Screenwriter [[Hanns Kräly]] was nominated twice for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing]] at the [[2nd Academy Awards]], for this film and ''[[The Patriot (1928 film)|The Patriot]]'', winning for the latter.<ref name=""Oscars1930"">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1930|title=The 2nd Academy Awards (1930) Nominees and Winners|access-date=May 20, 2019|work=oscars.org}}</ref> ==See also== * [[List of early sound feature films (1926–1929)]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== *{{IMDb title|0020081|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney}} *{{tcmdb title|80882|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney}} *{{allmovie|98748|Synopsis}} *[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zAoyoHwC5IQ/Sr_IC-AmyLI/AAAAAAAAFc0/gp6A3iZGURU/s400/Last+of+Mrs.+Cheyney+(1929)+poster+1.jpg Film poster] {{Sidney Franklin}} {{Irving Thalberg}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Last of Mrs. Cheyney, The}} [[Category:1929 films]] [[Category:1929 comedy-drama films]] [[Category:American comedy-drama films]] [[Category:American black-and-white films]] [[Category:American films based on plays]] [[Category:Films directed by Sidney Franklin]] [[Category:Films produced by Irving Thalberg]] [[Category:Films set in Monaco]] [[Category:Films set in London]] [[Category:1920s English-language films]] [[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]] [[Category:1920s American films]]",NA

Zanuck Productions }} '''''In Old Chicago''''' is a 1938 American [[disaster]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]. The screenplay by [[Sonya Levien]] and [[Lamar Trotti]] was based on the [[Niven Busch]] story, ""We the O'Learys"". The film is a fictionalized account about the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 and stars [[Alice Brady]] as [[Catherine O'Leary|Mrs. O'Leary]], the owner of the cow which started the fire, and [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Don Ameche]] as her sons. It also stars [[Alice Faye]] and [[Andy Devine]]. At the time of its release, it was one of the most expensive movies ever made. ==Plot== The O'Leary family are traveling to Chicago to start a new life when Patrick O'Leary tries to race a steam train in his wagon. He is killed when his wagon hits a bump and his horses break loose, dragging him. His wife Molly and their three boys are left to survive on their own. In town she agrees to prove her skills as a laundress when a woman's dress is accidentally spattered with mud. She quickly proves herself and builds a laundry business in an area known as ""[[West Town, Chicago#Smith Park|the Patch]]"". Her sons are educated. One, Jack, becomes a reforming lawyer, but another, Dion, is involved in gambling. While washing a sheet, Mrs. O'Leary discovers a drawing, apparently created by Gil Warren, a devious local businessman. Her sons realize that it reveals that he has a plan to run a tramline along a street that he and his cronies intend to buy up cheaply. Dion becomes enamored with a feisty saloon-bar singer, Belle, who works for Warren. After a stormy courtship they become lovers. Meanwhile, Bob, the youngest O'Leary son, who helps his mother, is in love with Gretchen, an innocent German girl. They meet in the barn watched by the O'Leary's cow Daisy and plan to marry. Mrs. O'Leary approves of the match, but expresses disdain for the loose-living Belle. Dion and Belle bribe the local politicians to set up a saloon on the street where the tramline will pass. Dion makes a deal to support Warren's political career and carve up business in the town. However, Dion's dishonest practices lead to conflict with his brother Jack when one of Dion's cronies is arrested for multiple voting. Dion later decides to support his brother rather than Warren in the election, convinced he can cut out Warren altogether and reign-in Jack's reformist zeal. He is increasingly attracted by the daughter of the corrupt local senator, leading to conflicts with Belle. Bob and Gretchen marry and have a baby. At a Warren election rally a fight breaks out, arranged by Dion. All Warren's election workers are arrested. Jack is elected mayor. He soon announces a campaign against corruption, targeting his brother's fiefdom in the Patch, which he intends to demolish. Belle and Dion separate when Jack asks her to support him. When he realizes Belle might testify against him, Dion asks her to marry him, making her testimony inadmissible. As mayor, Jack marries the couple, but knocks Dion out in a fist fight as soon he realizes he has been deceived. Mrs. O'Leary is told about the fight while helping Daisy's calf to suckle. In her distress, she leaves a lamp in the barn, and Daisy knocks it over. A fire breaks out. Soon the whole of the Patch is on fire. Dion, Warren and their cronies are convinced that Jack has set the fire. Warren's men look for Jack, seeking revenge. Advised by [[Philip Sheridan]], Jack plans to create a firebreak by dynamiting buildings to stop the fire reaching the gasworks, but Warren's gang try to stop him. When Dion learns from Bob how the fire really started, he rushes to Jack's aid. In the struggle, Jack and Dion fight off the gang and set off the [[dynamite]], but Jack is shot by one of Warren's thugs and then killed by a falling building. Warren attempts to flee but is trampled to death by stampeding cattle from the stockyards. Dion and Bob help to save Gretchen and the baby, while Belle rescues Mrs O'Leary. They all manage to escape to the river. Belle and Dion are reconciled, and Mrs. O'Leary predicts that the city will be rebuilt and flourish after her son's sacrifice for its future. ==Cast== * [[Tyrone Power]] as Dion O'Leary * [[Alice Faye]] as Belle Fawcett * [[Don Ameche]] as Jack O'Leary * [[Alice Brady]] as Mrs. [[Catherine O'Leary|Molly O'Leary]] * [[Phyllis Brooks]] as Ann Colby * [[Andy Devine]] as Pickle Bixby * [[Brian Donlevy]] as Gil Warren * [[Tom Brown (actor)|Tom Brown]] as Bob O'Leary * [[Berton Churchill]] as Senator Colby * [[Sidney Blackmer]] as [[Phillip Sheridan|General Phil Sheridan]] * J.

However, due to Harlow's untimely death, the part went to [[Alice Faye]]. Faye's popularity skyrocketed as a result of the picture, and she was reunited with Power and Ameche that same year for ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'', which proved to be even more successful.<ref name=Parish232>{{citation |last1=Parish |first1=James Robert |last2=Mank |first2=Gregory W. |last3=Stanke |first3=Don E. |title=The Hollywood Beauties |year=1978 |publisher=Arlington House Publishers |location=New Rochelle, New York |isbn=0-87000-412-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/hollywoodbeautie00pari/page/232 232] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hollywoodbeautie00pari/page/232 }}</ref> Some sources claim that MGM offered to loan both Harlow and [[Clark Gable]] to Fox for ''In Old Chicago'' if they reciprocated by loaning [[Shirley Temple]] to MGM for their upcoming production of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

She was the first person to win the Supporting Oscar after being nominated in the prior year. The film was also nominated in the categories of [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Music (Scoring)]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Sound Recording]] ([[E. H.

The area known as ""the Patch"" did exist as a predominantly Irish neighbourhood, and was associated with crime, as portrayed in the film.<ref>Herbert Asbury, ''The gangs of Chicago: an informal history of the Chicago underworld'', Random House, 2003, p.xvii.</ref> In the years before the film was made it had been supplanted by [[the Levee]], an area renowned for its corrupt politicians, known as the [[Gray Wolves (Chicago)|Gray Wolves]], whose deeds resemble those of the characters in the film.<ref>[[William Targ|Targ, William]], ''Indecent pleasures: the life and colorful times of William Targ'', Macmillan, 1975, p.17.</ref> The portrayal of the O'Leary family is largely fictitious down to the names of the characters. Mrs. O'Leary's name was Catherine, not Molly. The O'Learys had two children, one son and one daughter. In the movie there are three sons. Her only son was named [[James Patrick O'Leary]]. The daughter was named Anna. Their father Patrick O'Leary did not die in 1854 as a result of an accident involving his horses. He died in 1894.<ref name=""graveyard"">{{cite web| publisher=Graveyards of Chicago| title=Patrick and Catherine O'Leary| url=http://graveyards.com/IL/Cook/mtolivet/oleary.html| access-date=2011-09-23}}</ref> Mrs. O'Leary did not run her own ""French Laundry"" out of their house. The Mayor of Chicago in 1871 was [[Roswell B. Mason]], not an O'Leary son. However, Mason was elected on a reform ticket like the fictional Jack and took similar measures to deal with the fire. Mrs. O'Leary's son James Patrick did achieve success as a gambler and saloon owner comparable to that of Dion in the film. ==Trivia== [[Scotty Mattraw]] and [[Eddie Collins (actor)|Eddie Collins]] both worked as voice actors in [[Walt Disney]]'s first animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' the previous year, with Mattraw voicing Bashful and Collins voicing Dopey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs/|title = Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs}}</ref> ==Home media== The film was released and restored to its full length on DVD in 2005. ==See also== * [[List of firefighting films]] ==References== {{reflist|colwidth=30em}} ==External links== * {{AFI film|984|In Old Chicago}} * {{Rotten Tomatoes|in_old_chicago|In Old Chicago}} * {{IMDb title|0029047|In Old Chicago}} * {{AllMovie title|id=79100}} * {{tcmdb title|id= 53021}} {{Henry King}} {{Darryl F.

The film was directed by [[H. C. Potter]] and produced independently for [[Paramount Pictures]] by [[Boris Morros]], with associate producers Robert Stillman and (uncredited) Fred Astaire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/27042|title = AFI&#124;Catalog}}</ref> The film's copyright expired in 1968 and it is now in the [[public domain]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvcHAQAAMAAJ&q=second+chorus+1940+public+domain|last=Simosko|first=Vladimir|title=Artie Shaw: A Musical Biography and Discography|year=2000|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810833975}}page 89</ref> ==Plot== Danny O'Neill ([[Fred Astaire]]) and Hank Taylor ([[Burgess Meredith]]) are friends and rival trumpeters with ""O'Neill's Perennials"", a college band. Both have managed to prolong their college careers by failing seven years in a row. At a performance, Ellen Miller ([[Paulette Goddard]]) catches both Danny's and Hank's eyes. However, she serves them a summons notice for her boss, a debt collector, but the fast-talking O'Neill and Taylor soon have her working as their manager, where her business savvy increases their gigs. Meanwhile, tired of losing several gigs to the Perennials, [[Artie Shaw]] (playing himself) comes to persuade Ellen to be his booking manager. Ellen tries to get Danny and Hank an audition for Artie Shaw's band, but their jealous hi-jinks get them the boot. Ellen talks Shaw into letting rich wannabee mandolin musician J. Lester Chisholm ([[Charles Butterworth (actor)|Charles Butterworth]]) back a concert. It looks like Ellen's plan to get Chisholm as backer fails, when Hank pretends to be Ellen's jealous husband — then her brother. But using the brother ploy, Danny and Hank manage to get Chisholm back on board, then get Shaw to agree to put Danny's song into the show. All they have to do is keep Chisholm and his mandolin — which he wants to play in the concert — away from Shaw until after the show. Hank's solution is to drop sleeping pills into Chisholm's drink, but Chisholm knocks out Hank too, with the same stuff. To Ellen's relief, Danny finally acts responsibly, arranging his number for the show, which Shaw says ""has really grown up into something special."" He hands the baton to Danny, who successfully conducts his own composition whilst simultaneously also tap-dancing in front of the band. Danny and Ellen then drive off together into the night. ==Cast== * [[Fred Astaire]] as Danny O'Neill * [[Paulette Goddard]] as Ellen Miller * [[Artie Shaw]] as himself * [[Charles Butterworth (actor)|Charles Butterworth]] as Mr. Chisholm * [[Burgess Meredith]] as Hank Taylor * Frank Melton as Stu * [[Jimmy Conlin]] as Mr. Dunn * [[Don Brodie]] as clerk * [[Marjorie Kane]] as secretary * [[Joan Barclay]] as receptionist * [[Willa Pearl Curtis]] as scrubwoman * [[Billy Butterfield]] as himself / Shaw's Band Trumpeter '''Cast notes''' *Billy Butterfield dubbed Burgess Meredith's trumpet solo. ==Musical numbers== [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]] collaborated with Astaire on the choreography. * ""[[Sugar (Maceo Pinkard song)|Sugar]]"": Astaire is shown leading a college band in a jazz standard by Marceo Pinkard. Astaire's trumpet playing is dubbed by [[Bobby Hackett]], while Meredith's is dubbed by Shaw's bandsman [[Billy Butterfield]]. * ""Everything's Jumping"": A brief number for Artie Shaw and his band. * ""I Ain't Hep To That Step But I'll Dig It"": This comic song and dance duet for Astaire and Goddard was, according to Goddard - whose dance ability and experience was limited - done ""just once, one Saturday morning ... I'm glad it was all right for I couldn't have done it again"". It was the last of Astaire's duets to be filmed entirely in one take. The dance incorporates a new step, the ""Dig It"" which involved snapping both feet together and then hopping while keeping them together. The rest of the dance involves original use of partnered teetering, scooting and dodging steps with some [[jitterbug]]ging thrown in. In his first film appearance, Hermes Pan can be seen as the clarinetist in the band (standing farthest back).<ref>John Franceschina, ''Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire'' (Oxford University Press, 2012); {{ISBN|0199913064}}</ref> * ""[[Sweet Sue, Just You|Sweet Sue]]"": Another Astaire (Hackett) and Meredith (Butterfield) mime routine, this time to a [[Victor Young]] standard. * ""Love Of My Life"": [[Johnny Mercer]] and Shaw wrote this song one day over lunch at Mercer's house, and when the excited Shaw wanted to show it to the studio, Mercer persuaded him to wait three weeks explaining: ""If you tell them you just wrote it over lunch they won't think it's any good"". It is delivered by Astaire to Goddard and garnered an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Song. * ""Kamarinskaya"": A brief comic number for Astaire, who plays a Russian doing a Moiseyev-style dance to the traditional Russian melody while singing a pseudo-Russian version of ""Love Of My Life"" in a thick accent. * ""Poor Mr. Chisholm "": Accompanying himself on the piano Astaire sings this folk-parody Mercer-Henighen number for Shaw's approval. * ""Concerto for Clarinet"": Like many jazzmen of his time &ndash; [[Benny Goodman]], [[Paul Whiteman]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]] and [[Duke Ellington]] among them &ndash; Shaw occasionally produced pieces with titles more commonly associated with classical music; Shaw, however was characteristically modest about this attractively episodic extended piece, composed especially for the film: ""I never intended it for posterity ... It filled a spot in the picture"". It features the string section &ndash; Shaw's ""mice men"" as he liked to call them, which he had just added to band &ndash; most famously in ""[[Frenesi]]"" - the year before. * ""Hoe Down The Bayou/Poor Mr. Chisholm (dance)"": Astaire ""conducts"" the band while performing a tap solo. The only number involving Astaire and Pan, possibly the most important choreographic collaboration in the history of filmed dance{{fact|date=October 2022}} - was ""Me And The Ghost Upstairs"", which was cut from the final film, but is currently included in some regional DVD versions of the film. In it, Pan, shrouded in a sheet, creeps up on Astaire and begins to mimic him. The two then dance a riotous number involving [[Lindy Hop|Lindy]] lifts and jitterbugging. It is not really finished to Astaire's usual standards, and this, combined with the fact that the figure under the shroud is obviously male, wearing women's high heels, may have led to its deletion. ==Production== In a 1968 interview, Astaire described this effort as ""the worst film I ever made."" Astaire admitted that he was attracted to the film by the opportunity to ""dance-conduct this real swingin' outfit"". In an interview shortly before his death, Shaw admitted this film put him off acting. Astaire and Shaw shared a striking series of personality traits in common: an obsessive perfectionism and seemingly endless appetite for retakes, profound musicality and love of jazz, personal modesty and charm, and in a late interview Shaw expressed his opinion of Astaire: ""Astaire really sweat - he toiled. He was a humorless Teutonic man, the opposite of his debonair image in top hat and tails. I liked him because he was an entertainer and an artist. There's a distinction between them. An artist is concerned only with what is acceptable to himself, where an entertainer strives to please the public. Astaire did both. [[Louis Armstrong]] was another one.""<ref>Interviewed in Fantle, Dave and Johnson, Tom. ''Reel to Real''.

Kyser is suspicious of mystic Prince Saliano, and for good reason. He is taking advantage of the heiress' Aunt Bellacrest's belief in spiritualism to swindle the estate out of large sums of money. Saliano has been ""planted"" in the house by the ""respectable"" family attorney, Judge Mainwaring. Also in on the swindle is Professor Fenninger, who claims to be an expert on uncovering phony spiritualists (something he has no real intention of doing). After a series of typical ""haunted house"" jokes, Kyser uncovers a basement ""command center"" that provides the special effects for Saliano's phony seances. The three criminals attempt to escape using dynamite as a shield. But a friendly dog retrieves the lit stick and returns it to the criminals. There is a loud explosion, and the dog returns carrying Saliano's turban. ==Cast== {{Cast listing| * [[Kay Kyser]] as himself * [[Peter Lorre]] as Professor Karl Fenninger * [[Boris Karloff]] as Judge Spencer Mainwaring * [[Bela Lugosi]] as Prince Saliano * [[Helen Parrish]] as Janis Bellacrest * [[Dennis O'Keefe]] as Chuck Deems * [[Alma Kruger]] as Aunt Margo Bellacrest * Joseph Eggenton as Jurgen, Butler * [[Kay Kyser|Kay Kyser's Band]] as Themselves * [[Harry Babbitt]] as himself * [[Ginny Simms]] as herself * [[Ish Kabibble]] as himself * Sully Mason as himself }} ==See also== * [[Boris Karloff filmography]] * [[Bela Lugosi filmography]] ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * {{IMDb title|0033283}} * {{AllMovie title|55931}} * {{TCMDb title|id=1634}} * {{AFI film|id=6806|title=You'll Find Out}} {{David Butler}} {{Kay Kyser}} [[Category:1940 films]] [[Category:1940 comedy films]] [[Category:American comedy films]] [[Category:American black-and-white films]] [[Category:1940s English-language films]] [[Category:Films directed by David Butler]] [[Category:Films scored by Roy Webb]] [[Category:RKO Pictures films]] [[Category:1940s American films]] [[Category:English-language comedy films]] {{1940s-comedy-film-stub}}",NA

It was originally written for American soldiers to help them understand why the [[United States]] was involved in the war, but US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered distribution for [[public information film|public viewing]]. [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning filmmaker [[Frank Capra]], daunted but impressed and challenged by [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s 1935 [[propaganda film]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', worked in direct response. The series faced various challenges, such as convincing a [[noninterventionist]] nation to get involved in the war and to become an ally of the [[Soviet Union]]. Many entries feature [[Axis powers]]' propaganda footage from up to 20 years earlier, recontextualized to promote the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Although primarily edited by [[William Hornbeck]], some parts were re-enacted ""under [[United States Department of War|War Department]] supervision"" if no relevant footage was available. Animated segments were produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], and the animated maps followed a convention of depicting Axis-occupied territory in black. ==Purpose== [[File:transmitlies.jpeg|right|thumb|''[[Prelude to War]]'' depicts the Nazi propaganda machine.]][[File:Whywefight30vs200.png|right|thumb|''War Comes to America'' demonstrates [[North America]]'s hopeless position in the event of an Axis victory in [[Afro-Eurasia]].]] After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 and America's subsequent joining [[World War II]], American film director [[Frank Capra]] enlisted with the armed forces. He was already an established Hollywood director responsible for directing films winning [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] such as ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934) and ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939). He was assigned to work directly under [[George Marshall]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]]. Marshall felt that the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], an army branch responsible for communications, was incapable of producing ""sensitive and objective troop information films"". One colonel explained the importance of these future films to Capra: {{blockquote|You were the answer to the General's prayer.&nbsp;... You see, Frank, this idea about films to explain ""Why"" the boys are in uniform is General Marshall's own baby, and he wants the nursery right next to his Chief of Staff's office.{{Sfn | Capra | 1971 | p = 322}}}} During his first meeting with Marshall, Capra received his mission: {{blockquote|Now, Capra, I want to nail down with you a plan to make a series of documented, factual-information films—the first in our history—that will explain to our boys in the Army ''why'' we are fighting, and the ''principles'' for which we are fighting.&nbsp;... You have an opportunity to contribute enormously to your country and the cause of freedom. Are you aware of that, sir?{{Sfn | Capra | 1971 | p = 326}}}} ===Countering enemy propaganda films=== Shortly after his meeting with General Marshall, Capra viewed [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ""terrifying motion picture"", ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. Capra describes the film as ""the ominous prelude of Hitler's holocaust of hate. Satan couldn't have devised a more blood-chilling super-spectacle.&nbsp;... Though panoplied with all the pomp and mystical trappings of a Wagnerian opera, its message was as blunt and brutal as a lead pipe: We, the Herrenvolk, are the new invincible gods!""<ref name=Capra />{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} According to Capra, ''Triumph of the Will'' ""fired no gun, dropped no bombs. But as a psychological weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist, it was just as lethal."" Capra still had no assistants or facilities, and he began to see his assignment as overwhelming: {{blockquote|I sat alone and pondered. How could I mount a counterattack against ''Triumph of the Will''; keep alive ''our'' will to resist the master race? I was alone; no studio, no equipment, no personnel.<ref name=Capra />{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} }} ===Creating a powerful film idea=== Capra made his primary focus the creation of ""one basic, powerful idea"" that would spread and evolve into other related ideas. He considered one important idea that had always been in his thoughts: {{blockquote|I thought of the Bible. There was one sentence in it that always gave me goose pimples: ""Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.""<ref name=Capra />}} As a result, his goal became to ""let the ''enemy'' prove to our soldiers the enormity of his cause—and the justness of ours."" He would compile enemy speeches, films, newsreels, newspaper articles, with a list of the enemy's hostile actions. He presented his ideas to other officers who were now assigned to help him: {{blockquote|I told them of my hunch: Use the enemy's own films to expose their enslaving ends. Let our boys hear the Nazis and the Japs shout their own claims of master-race crud—and our fighting men will ''know'' why they are in uniform.<ref name=Capra />}} Weeks later, after major efforts and disappointments, Capra located hard-to-reach archives within government facilities, and by avoiding normal channels, he was able to gain access: {{blockquote|Peterson and I walked away on air. We had found the great cache of enemy films—and it was ours!<ref name=Capra />}} ==Description== [[File:Capra-Army-45.jpg|thumb|Frank Capra receiving the Distinguished Service Medal from U.S. Army Chief of Staff General [[George C.

This last film of the series was, and still is, one of the most graphic visual histories of the United States ever made.""<ref name=Capra />{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} ==Production== Produced from 1942 to 1945, the seven installments range from 40 to 76 minutes in length, and all are available for free on [[DVD]] or online since they have always been [[public domain]] material by the US government.

Other scenes were performed. Animation was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Studios]]. The quotation ending each film (""The victory of the democracies can only be complete with the ''utter defeat'' of the war machines of Germany and Japan"") is from the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George Marshall]]. ==Accuracy== ''Prelude to War'' and ''The Battle of China'' refer to the ''[[Tanaka Memorial]]'' several times by portraying it as ""[[Japan]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''"" in order to raise US morale for a protracted war against Japan. The authenticity of that document is not accepted by scholars today, and it is regarded as an [[anti-Japanese]] hoax, but the ''Tanaka'' Memorial was widely accepted as authentic in the 1930s and the 1940s because Japanese actions corresponded so closely to its plans. To justify the [[Western Allies]]' help to the [[Soviet Union]], the series omitted many facts which could have cast the Soviets in a negative light, such as the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic States]] and the [[Winter War]]. However, it shows the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] being signed and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]].{{Sfn|Biskupski|2010|pp=151–52}} ==Impact== After [[World War I]], methods used to gain support from troops and civilians needed to change. Giving speeches to soldier recruits and to the US public was no longer effective. Film became the medium of choice to persuade US soldiers and recruits on why fighting was necessary.{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=69}} As Kathleen German stated, ""this was the first massive attempt to influence opinion in the U.S. military"" through film.{{Sfn|German|1990|p=237}} Film was also chosen because it combined the senses of sight and hearing, which gives it an advantage over radio or print.{{Sfn|German|1990|p=238}} Capra, who had no experience in documentary films, was chosen because ""of his commitment to American ideals"" and because of the popularity of some of his earlier feature films. He was thought ""to understand the heart and soul of American audiences"".{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=69}} Once the documentary series was completed, it was said to contain the ""Capra touch"".{{Sfn|Koppes|Black|1987|p=76}} The series's appeal was furthered by its editing. ""Throughout his career, Capra depended upon his skill as an editor to achieve the contrast of the individual and the group, critical in the success of his Hollywood movies.""{{Sfn|German|1990|p=240}} Capra thought that it would be most effective to use the enemy's original film and propaganda in the series to expose the enemies with their own images. By taking pieces of the enemy material to edit together and placing his own narration over the results, Capra gave meaning and purpose to the war with added narrative.{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=70}} That ""parallel editing""{{Sfn|German|1990|p=241}} created an ""us vs. them"" image by re-framing and showing clips out of their original order and context. By such careful editing, the films compare and contrast the forces of evil with the U.S. and its traditional values. Capra highlighted the differences between the US and the enemy and showed how the enemy would attack these values if ""we"" did not fight.{{Sfn|German|1990}}{{Page needed|date=August 2014}} That worked to create a battle not only between [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers]] but also between good and evil. Capra treated it as a matter of showing the enormity of the Axis and the justness of the Allies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Overy|author-link=Richard Overy|title=Why the Allies Won|year=1996 |page=295|isbn=0-393-03925-0}}.</ref> The ''Why We Fight'' series became a heavily-used means of presenting information about Axis powers for the American government during WWII. General Surles, director of the Department of War's Bureau of Public Relations, had hoped that the series would be effective enough to allow similar kinds of army films to be shown to the general public.{{Sfn|Koppes|Black|1987|p=122}} Surles saw that goal to be realized when US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] watched ''Prelude to War'', the most successful of the seven. Roosevelt considered it so important that he ordered its distribution in civilian arenas for public viewing.{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=70}} However, some objections were raised against the series due to its persuasiveness. [[Lowell Mellett]], coordinator of government films and aide to Roosevelt, saw the films as dangerous. He was most concerned with the effect that the series would have after the war was over and the ""hysteria"" that it would create in its wake.{{Sfn|Koppes|Black|1987|p=122}} At least 54 million Americans had seen the series by the end of the war, and studies were done to gauge the impact of the films. However, results were inconclusive, and so the effectiveness of the series is still in question.{{Sfn|Rollins|1996|p=81}} ==Legacy== Created by the US Army Pictorial Services, the films are in the [[public domain]], and all of them are available for download on the [[Internet Archive]]. In 2000 the US [[Library of Congress]] deemed the films ""culturally significant"" and selected them for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref> ==List of films== <gallery heights=""300"" mode=""nolines""> File:Why We Fight- Prelude to War.webm|''[[Prelude to War]]'' File:Why We Fight- The Nazis Strike.webm|''[[The Nazis Strike]]'' File:Why We Fight- Divide and Conquer.webm|''[[Divide and Conquer (film)|Divide and Conquer]]'' File:Why We Fight- The Battle of Britain.webm|''[[The Battle of Britain]]'' File:Why We Fight The Battle of Russia.webm|''[[The Battle of Russia]]'' File:Why We Fight- The Battle of China.webm|''[[The Battle of China]]'' File:Why We Fight- War Comes to America.webm|''[[War Comes to America]]'' </gallery> ==Other Capra World War II films== Capra was involved in a number of other World War II propaganda films that were not part of the ''Why We Fight'' series.

The film, which was written by [[Frank Butler (writer)|Frank Butler]] and [[Don Hartman]] and directed by [[David Butler (director)|David Butler]] for [[Paramount Pictures]], is the third of the ""''[[Road to …]]''"" films. It was preceded by ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941) and followed by ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946). The story is about two fast-talking guys castaway on a desert shore and sold into [[slavery]] to a beautiful princess. The setting is in [[Morocco]]. ==Plot== The film opens with a sea freighter exploding. While the cause of the explosion remains a mystery, two stowaways, Jeff Peters and Orville 'Turkey' Jackson, are seen floating on wreckage. It is revealed that Orville's smoking habit caused the blast, and the two men joke about cannibalism as they spot land. Upon reaching the beach, Orville reminds Jeff of his promise to Aunt Lucy to take care of him, but Jeff says she died before he could agree to it. Conveniently, a camel appears, and they hitch a ride. As Jeff and Orville make their way into the city, they are nearly run over by Arabs led by Sheik Mullay Kasim, who has come to propose to Princess Shalmar. Orville is approached by men carrying a mysterious woman in a veiled box, and her hand takes his before they leave. While at a restaurant, Jeff and Orville plan to skip out on the bill, but a man takes Jeff aside and gives him some money. Jeff had sold Orville, and although he is initially angry, he eventually calms down after Jeff promises to buy him back. Two men then throw a hood over Orville and carry him off. Jeff has a vision of Aunt Lucy, who shames him for selling Orville. He attempts to buy Orville back but discovers that he has been sold once again. Aunt Lucy then advises Jeff to find Orville and suggests that he sing his favorite song. Jeff walks and sings until a note and Orville's locket are thrown from the palace, warning him of danger. Jeff climbs over the palace wall and hears a woman singing. He sneaks in and finds Orville with Princess Shalmar and other beautiful girls. Jeff storms into the palace but is caught by guards. Orville pretends not to know him, resulting in the princess dismissing everyone except Jeff. Orville then confesses to their engagement, but the princess reveals that she bought him and that her wise man advised her to marry him. The princess invites Jeff to stay, and Orville is waited on by girls, including Mihirmah, who confesses her love for him. Jeff confronts Orville, who then has him thrown out. Later, Jeff sings and attracts the princess, and they go for a walk. Mihirmah tries to convince Orville to leave with her. Jeff tells the princess that he should be the one marrying her, but Orville threatens him with a sword. The following day, Kasim threatens to kill Orville, but the princess takes him to the wise man, who reveals a prophecy: the first husband will die a violent death within a week of marriage, and the second will have a long and happy life. The princess declares that Orville is the first husband, and Kasim finally understands. Orville learns of the prophecy and runs off with Mihirmah, convincing Jeff that the princess actually loves him. That night, Aunt Lucy's spirit rebukes Orville. Princess Shalmar refuses to marry Jeff and sends Orville away to prepare for the wedding. Later, the wise man tells the princess and Jeff that he misread the stars and that the prophecy is incorrect. Jeff now understands why Orville wanted to avoid the marriage, and tells him that the princess has changed her mind. Meanwhile, Kasim learns of the news and rallies his men. Princess Shalmar and Jeff decide to get married in the United States along with Orville and Mihirmah. However, Kasim intervenes and abducts the princess while giving Mihirmah to one of his men. Jeff and Orville attempt to use their 'patty-cake' routine on Kasim, but it fails, and they end up getting captured along with the girls. Kasim leaves Jeff and Orville stranded in the desert and takes the women with him. While wandering in the desert, they discover an oasis near Kasim's camp. They try to sneak in but are caught. They then witness a clash between two sheiks and take advantage of the chaos to escape with the girls. Eventually, they board a boat back home. However, things take a dangerous turn when Orville causes an explosion while smoking in the powder room. Fortunately, they all survive by clinging onto a pile of wreckage near New York harbor. ==Cast== {{col-begin}}{{col-break}} * [[Bing Crosby]] as Jeff Peters * [[Bob Hope]] as Orville ""Turkey"" Jackson * [[Dorothy Lamour]] as Princess Shalmar * [[Anthony Quinn]] as Mullay Kasim * [[Dona Drake]] as Mihirmah * [[Vladimir Sokoloff]] as Hyder Khan * [[Mikhail Rasumny]] as Ahmed Fey * [[George Givot]] as Neb Jolla * [[Leon Belasco]] as Yusef {{col-break|gap=4em}} * [[Monte Blue]] as Second aide to Mullay Kassim * [[George Lloyd (actor)|George Lloyd]] as First guard * [[Dan Seymour]] as Arabian buyer * [[Stanley Price]] as Idiot * [[Louise LaPlanche]] as handmaiden * [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as handmaiden * [[Brandon Hurst]] as English announcer * [[Nestor Paiva]] as Arab sausage vendor * [[Cy Kendall]] as Fruit stall proprietor (uncredited) * [[Kent Rogers]] as Male Camel (voice, uncredited) {{col-end}} ==Reception== The film was placed at No. 4 in the list of [[1942 in film|top-grossing movies]] for 1942 in the USA. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' liked it: ""Let us be thankful that Paramount is still blessed with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and that it has set its cameras to tailing these two irrepressible wags on another fantastic excursion, ''Road to Morocco'', which came to the Paramount yesterday. For the screen, under present circumstances, can hold no more diverting lure than the prospect of Hope and Crosby ambling, as they have done before, through an utterly slaphappy picture, picking up Dorothy Lamour along the way and tossing acid wisecracks at each other without a thought for reason or sense...The short of it is that ''Road to Morocco'' is a daffy, laugh-drafting film. And you’ll certainly agree with the camel which, at one point, offers the gratuitous remark, 'This is the screwiest picture I was ever in'.""<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1942/11/12/archives/road-to-morocco-with-bing-crosby-bob-hope-dorothy-lamour-at.html|title=' Road to Morocco,' With Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour at Paramount -- Other Films |journal=The New York Times|date=November 12, 1942|access-date=May 25, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented: ""Crosby, Hope and Lamour have done it again.

Leonard]], and starring [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Walter Brennan]]. [[Marilyn Maxwell]] made her film debut in this feature. Suggested by a story by Laurence Kirk, and with an original story by Captain Harvey Haislip and [[R. C. Sherriff]], the film's screenplay was written by George Bruce, [[John L. Balderston]], and [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]]. ==Plot== During the early months of U.S. involvement in [[World War II]], well-connected, Harvard-educated Lieutenant Gregg Masterman enjoys his cushy posting as the junior aide to Rear Admiral Stephen ""Old Ironpants"" Thomas, playing tennis and arranging various Navy social functions. During a chance encounter, he gives bad advice to up-from-the-ranks Lieutenant Commander Martin J. Roberts. As a result, Thomas gives Roberts command of a once obsolete but now reconditioned [[World War I]]-era destroyer, the USS ''Warren''. To his dismay, however, Masterman finds himself reassigned by Admiral Thomas as Roberts' new [[executive officer]]. When Masterman learns that Henry Johnson, the ship's civilian caretaker, was a member of the ''Warren''{{'}}s original crew during the war and is familiar with the ship's quirks, he helps him to reenlist in the Navy with his old rating and once again serve aboard his beloved ship. Despite his awkward beginning, Masterman begins to turn into an effective sea officer under Roberts' tutelage, though Roberts has to constantly remind him that he cannot put the welfare of any person over that of their mission. The first time a Japanese plane attacks the ''Warren'', though, it is Masterman's error that keeps them from shooting it down. Admiral Thomas is put in charge of a [[convoy]] of ships from Honolulu to San Francisco, but one of the escort destroyers breaks down and USS ''Warren'' is assigned to replace it. While traveling at flank speed through a heavy Pacific squall to join the convoy, Johnson falls and suffers a [[concussion]]. Masterman violates orders and reduces speed to give Johnson a smoother ride for a while. Johnson improves but remains delirious, believing he is back aboard the destroyer during World War I. Before reaching the convoy, the ''Warren'' comes across a lifeboat from a ship that had to separate from it and was torpedoed. On it are two crewmen and a party being evacuated from a maternity hospital: two pregnant women and 20 babies. Masterman and the crew must deal with them, including two births. Another Japanese plane attacks and cripples Admiral Thomas's flagship, damaging its steering mechanism. The ''Warren'' shoots the plane down, but its battleship emerges from a thick fog bank and opens fire on the flagship. It is up to the ''Warren''{{'}}s crew to take immediate battle action. Roberts informs Masterman of his attack plan: to set up a heavy [[smoke screen]], double-back behind it, then charge through the smoke and launch a spread of [[torpedo]]es into the battleship at close range. When the captain is injured, Masterman must assume command. The injured Johnson is able to escape from sickbay and appears at the destroyer's helm shortly after the bridge crew are injured. He immediately takes charge under Masterman during the battle. The ''Warren'' successfully fires six torpedoes into the Japanese battleship, detonating its ammunition magazines and completely destroying the capital ship. After their return to San Francisco, a formal ceremony is held aboard the now repaired USS ''Warren'': a proud Admiral Thomas presents Roberts, Masterman, and a recovered Johnson with the Navy's highest honor, the [[Navy Cross]], awarded by the president. ==Cast== * [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]] as Lieutenant Gregg Masterman * [[Charles Laughton]] as Rear Admiral Stephen Thomas * [[Brian Donlevy]] as Lieutenant Commander Martin J.

The other titles were: ''Cargo of Innocence'' (the title under which the film was released in Great Britain), ''A Cargo of Innocents'', ''Men O'War'', ''Clear for Action'', ''Navy Convoy'', ''This Man's Navy'', and ''Pacific Task Force''.<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/91258/Stand-by-for-Action/notes.html ""Notes""] on TCM.com</ref> Although the film was shot in Hollywood, it was originally scheduled to be filmed in late 1941 at MGM's studio in England, with [[Clarence Brown]] directing [[Robert Donat]] and [[Edmund Gwenn]]. Film production was shifted to California, however, because of the U.S. war situation following Pearl Harbor.<ref name=tcmnotes /> The original intention was that the film would be set in the Atlantic Ocean and be about the Royal Navy. After the U.S. entered World War II, the story was shifted to focus on the U.S. Navy in the Pacific. This was the first naval war film made by MGM.<ref name=tcmnotes /> ==Release== The film premiered on New Year's Eve, 1942, in a number of cities, including [[Boston]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[San Diego, California]], and [[San Francisco]].<ref name=tcmoverview>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/91258/Stand-by-for-Action/ ""Overview""] on TCM.com</ref> MGM had previously screened the film for naval officers on bases in California.<ref name=tcmnotes /> ==Response== ===Critical response=== The critical response was not good, with the reviewer for ''Yank'' magazine saying that the film was ""not about The War, but about Hollywood's War"", and other reviewers comparing it to ''[[In Which We Serve]]'', the 1942 British naval film written by and starring [[Noël Coward]] and directed by Coward and [[David Lean]], with the earlier film being deemed superior.<ref name=tcmnotes /> [[Bosley Crowther]], the film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', thought that [[Charles Laughton]]'s performance was not his best, an opinion that Laughton himself agreed with, saying that it was like something out of ''[[H.M.S.

It was originally written for American soldiers to help them understand why the [[United States]] was involved in the war, but US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered distribution for [[public information film|public viewing]]. [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning filmmaker [[Frank Capra]], daunted but impressed and challenged by [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s 1935 [[propaganda film]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', worked in direct response. The series faced various challenges, such as convincing a [[noninterventionist]] nation to get involved in the war and to become an ally of the [[Soviet Union]]. Many entries feature [[Axis powers]]' propaganda footage from up to 20 years earlier, recontextualized to promote the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Although primarily edited by [[William Hornbeck]], some parts were re-enacted ""under [[United States Department of War|War Department]] supervision"" if no relevant footage was available. Animated segments were produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], and the animated maps followed a convention of depicting Axis-occupied territory in black. ==Purpose== [[File:transmitlies.jpeg|right|thumb|''[[Prelude to War]]'' depicts the Nazi propaganda machine.]][[File:Whywefight30vs200.png|right|thumb|''War Comes to America'' demonstrates [[North America]]'s hopeless position in the event of an Axis victory in [[Afro-Eurasia]].]] After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 and America's subsequent joining [[World War II]], American film director [[Frank Capra]] enlisted with the armed forces. He was already an established Hollywood director responsible for directing films winning [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] such as ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934) and ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939). He was assigned to work directly under [[George Marshall]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]]. Marshall felt that the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], an army branch responsible for communications, was incapable of producing ""sensitive and objective troop information films"". One colonel explained the importance of these future films to Capra: {{blockquote|You were the answer to the General's prayer.&nbsp;... You see, Frank, this idea about films to explain ""Why"" the boys are in uniform is General Marshall's own baby, and he wants the nursery right next to his Chief of Staff's office.{{Sfn | Capra | 1971 | p = 322}}}} During his first meeting with Marshall, Capra received his mission: {{blockquote|Now, Capra, I want to nail down with you a plan to make a series of documented, factual-information films—the first in our history—that will explain to our boys in the Army ''why'' we are fighting, and the ''principles'' for which we are fighting.&nbsp;... You have an opportunity to contribute enormously to your country and the cause of freedom. Are you aware of that, sir?{{Sfn | Capra | 1971 | p = 326}}}} ===Countering enemy propaganda films=== Shortly after his meeting with General Marshall, Capra viewed [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ""terrifying motion picture"", ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. Capra describes the film as ""the ominous prelude of Hitler's holocaust of hate. Satan couldn't have devised a more blood-chilling super-spectacle.&nbsp;... Though panoplied with all the pomp and mystical trappings of a Wagnerian opera, its message was as blunt and brutal as a lead pipe: We, the Herrenvolk, are the new invincible gods!""<ref name=Capra />{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} According to Capra, ''Triumph of the Will'' ""fired no gun, dropped no bombs. But as a psychological weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist, it was just as lethal."" Capra still had no assistants or facilities, and he began to see his assignment as overwhelming: {{blockquote|I sat alone and pondered. How could I mount a counterattack against ''Triumph of the Will''; keep alive ''our'' will to resist the master race? I was alone; no studio, no equipment, no personnel.<ref name=Capra />{{Page needed | date = August 2014}} }} ===Creating a powerful film idea=== Capra made his primary focus the creation of ""one basic, powerful idea"" that would spread and evolve into other related ideas. He considered one important idea that had always been in his thoughts: {{blockquote|I thought of the Bible. There was one sentence in it that always gave me goose pimples: ""Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.""<ref name=Capra />}} As a result, his goal became to ""let the ''enemy'' prove to our soldiers the enormity of his cause—and the justness of ours."" He would compile enemy speeches, films, newsreels, newspaper articles, with a list of the enemy's hostile actions. He presented his ideas to other officers who were now assigned to help him: {{blockquote|I told them of my hunch: Use the enemy's own films to expose their enslaving ends. Let our boys hear the Nazis and the Japs shout their own claims of master-race crud—and our fighting men will ''know'' why they are in uniform.<ref name=Capra />}} Weeks later, after major efforts and disappointments, Capra located hard-to-reach archives within government facilities, and by avoiding normal channels, he was able to gain access: {{blockquote|Peterson and I walked away on air. We had found the great cache of enemy films—and it was ours!<ref name=Capra />}} ==Description== [[File:Capra-Army-45.jpg|thumb|Frank Capra receiving the Distinguished Service Medal from U.S. Army Chief of Staff General [[George C.

Capra's synopsis: ""Dealt with who, what, where, why, and how we came to be the USA—the oldest major democratic republic still living under its original constitution.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&pg=PA390 ''America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry'', pp.&nbsp;390&nbsp;f.] Continuum International (New York), 2010.</ref> The films employed a great deal of [[stock footage]], including enemy propaganda (such as the Nazis' ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'') recontextualized to discredit its creators. Other scenes were performed. Animation was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Studios]]. The quotation ending each film (""The victory of the democracies can only be complete with the ''utter defeat'' of the war machines of Germany and Japan"") is from the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George Marshall]]. ==Accuracy== ''Prelude to War'' and ''The Battle of China'' refer to the ''[[Tanaka Memorial]]'' several times by portraying it as ""[[Japan]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''"" in order to raise US morale for a protracted war against Japan. The authenticity of that document is not accepted by scholars today, and it is regarded as an [[anti-Japanese]] hoax, but the ''Tanaka'' Memorial was widely accepted as authentic in the 1930s and the 1940s because Japanese actions corresponded so closely to its plans. To justify the [[Western Allies]]' help to the [[Soviet Union]], the series omitted many facts which could have cast the Soviets in a negative light, such as the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic States]] and the [[Winter War]]. However, it shows the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] being signed and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]].{{Sfn|Biskupski|2010|pp=151–52}} ==Impact== After [[World War I]], methods used to gain support from troops and civilians needed to change. Giving speeches to soldier recruits and to the US public was no longer effective. Film became the medium of choice to persuade US soldiers and recruits on why fighting was necessary.{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=69}} As Kathleen German stated, ""this was the first massive attempt to influence opinion in the U.S. military"" through film.{{Sfn|German|1990|p=237}} Film was also chosen because it combined the senses of sight and hearing, which gives it an advantage over radio or print.{{Sfn|German|1990|p=238}} Capra, who had no experience in documentary films, was chosen because ""of his commitment to American ideals"" and because of the popularity of some of his earlier feature films. He was thought ""to understand the heart and soul of American audiences"".{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=69}} Once the documentary series was completed, it was said to contain the ""Capra touch"".{{Sfn|Koppes|Black|1987|p=76}} The series's appeal was furthered by its editing. ""Throughout his career, Capra depended upon his skill as an editor to achieve the contrast of the individual and the group, critical in the success of his Hollywood movies.""{{Sfn|German|1990|p=240}} Capra thought that it would be most effective to use the enemy's original film and propaganda in the series to expose the enemies with their own images. By taking pieces of the enemy material to edit together and placing his own narration over the results, Capra gave meaning and purpose to the war with added narrative.{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=70}} That ""parallel editing""{{Sfn|German|1990|p=241}} created an ""us vs. them"" image by re-framing and showing clips out of their original order and context. By such careful editing, the films compare and contrast the forces of evil with the U.S. and its traditional values. Capra highlighted the differences between the US and the enemy and showed how the enemy would attack these values if ""we"" did not fight.{{Sfn|German|1990}}{{Page needed|date=August 2014}} That worked to create a battle not only between [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers]] but also between good and evil. Capra treated it as a matter of showing the enormity of the Axis and the justness of the Allies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Overy|author-link=Richard Overy|title=Why the Allies Won|year=1996 |page=295|isbn=0-393-03925-0}}.</ref> The ''Why We Fight'' series became a heavily-used means of presenting information about Axis powers for the American government during WWII. General Surles, director of the Department of War's Bureau of Public Relations, had hoped that the series would be effective enough to allow similar kinds of army films to be shown to the general public.{{Sfn|Koppes|Black|1987|p=122}} Surles saw that goal to be realized when US President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] watched ''Prelude to War'', the most successful of the seven. Roosevelt considered it so important that he ordered its distribution in civilian arenas for public viewing.{{Sfn|Combs|Combs|1994|p=70}} However, some objections were raised against the series due to its persuasiveness. [[Lowell Mellett]], coordinator of government films and aide to Roosevelt, saw the films as dangerous. He was most concerned with the effect that the series would have after the war was over and the ""hysteria"" that it would create in its wake.{{Sfn|Koppes|Black|1987|p=122}} At least 54 million Americans had seen the series by the end of the war, and studies were done to gauge the impact of the films. However, results were inconclusive, and so the effectiveness of the series is still in question.{{Sfn|Rollins|1996|p=81}} ==Legacy== Created by the US Army Pictorial Services, the films are in the [[public domain]], and all of them are available for download on the [[Internet Archive]]. In 2000 the US [[Library of Congress]] deemed the films ""culturally significant"" and selected them for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref> ==List of films== <gallery heights=""300"" mode=""nolines""> File:Why We Fight- Prelude to War.webm|''[[Prelude to War]]'' File:Why We Fight- The Nazis Strike.webm|''[[The Nazis Strike]]'' File:Why We Fight- Divide and Conquer.webm|''[[Divide and Conquer (film)|Divide and Conquer]]'' File:Why We Fight- The Battle of Britain.webm|''[[The Battle of Britain]]'' File:Why We Fight The Battle of Russia.webm|''[[The Battle of Russia]]'' File:Why We Fight- The Battle of China.webm|''[[The Battle of China]]'' File:Why We Fight- War Comes to America.webm|''[[War Comes to America]]'' </gallery> ==Other Capra World War II films== Capra was involved in a number of other World War II propaganda films that were not part of the ''Why We Fight'' series.

The film was directed by [[Max Nosseck]]. ''Dillinger'' was the first major film to star [[Lawrence Tierney]]. The [[B-movie]] was shot in black and white and features a smoke-bomb bank robbery edited into the film from the 1937 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[You Only Live Once (1937 film)|You Only Live Once]]''. The film was released on DVD by [[Warner Bros.]] for the ''Film Noir Classic Collections 2'' in 2005, even though the film generally is not regarded as being [[film noir]]. Some sequences were shot at Big Bear Lake, California. ==Plot summary== A newsreel plays, summing up the gangster life of John Dillinger in detail. At the end of the newsreel, Dillinger's father walks onto the stage and speaks to the movie audience about his son's childhood back in Indiana, which he says was ordinary and not very eventful, but concedes that his son had ambitions and wanted to go his own way. The young Dillinger left his town to find his fortune in Indianapolis, but soon ran out of money. The scene fades to a restaurant, where John is on a date and finds himself humiliated by the waiter who refuses to accept a check for the meal; John excuses himself, runs into a nearby grocery store and robs it for $7.20 in cash. He makes the clerk at the store believe he has a gun in his hand under the jacket. John is soon arrested for this felony, and he is sentenced to prison. When incarcerated, he becomes good friends with Specs Green, his cell mate. Specs is an infamous bank robber whose gang{{snd}}Marco Minnelli, Doc Madison and Kirk Otto{{snd}}are also in the same prison. John is impressed by Specs and his experience and intelligence, and begins to look up to him as a father figure. Because John has a much shorter sentence, he decides he will be the gang's outside help when he is released, intending to facilitate their escape. As soon as John is free, he holds up the box office at a movie theater. Before he does, he flirts with the female clerk, Helen Rogers, with the result that she refuses to identify him in the police line-up after the robbery. Instead she goes on a date with John. John continues his criminal spree of robberies for money to finance the escape of Specs' gang. When he has enough, he devises a plan to smuggle a barrel of firearms to the gang at their quarry job site. The plan succeeds, they add John to their gang, then start a crime wave of robberies in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]]. Specs sends John to scout for new targets because he is the only one not recognized by the witnesses at the quarry at the time of the gang's escape. John checks out the Farmer's Trust Bank, where he poses as a potential customer to get inside the office. He reports back to the gang that the security system is too sophisticated for them to bypass. Specs still wants to hit the bank, and getting tired of John's ego and trigger-happiness, he decides to get help from outside the gang. John suggests another way to get into the bank – with gas bombs. John convinces the rest of the gang of his way, and they successfully rob the bank. Back at the hideout, John demands the leader's usual double share of the loot. After John is captured but escapes from jail, he kills Specs and takes his place as the leader of the gang. Running low on cash, they decide to rob a mail train. In the process, gang member Kirk Otto is killed. The gang part for a few weeks to lay low, and John and Helen go on a big shopping spree. They meet with the rest of the gang at a cabin lodge owned by Kirk's surrogate parents. They stay there for a while, but when the elderly couple calls the police, Dillinger kills them. Later, they realize that the police are closing in on them, so they plan to head to the [[Western United States|Western States]] and continue robbing banks. Before going, Dillinger and his girlfriend spend an evening at the [[Biograph Theater|Biograph movie theater]] in Chicago. Exiting the theater, Dillinger sees the police coming after him. In a gunfight, he is killed in an alley, his only money is $7.20{{snd}}the same as what he took in his first robbery. ==Cast== {{Cast listing| * [[Lawrence Tierney]] as [[John Dillinger]] * [[Edmund Lowe]] as Specs Green * [[Anne Jeffreys]] as Helen Rogers * [[Eduardo Ciannelli|Eduardo Cianelli]] as Marco Minelli * [[Marc Lawrence]] as Doc Madison * [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as Kirk Otto * Ralph Lewis as Tony * Elsa Janssen as Mrs. Otto * [[Ludwig Stössel]] as Mr. Otto * [[Constance Worth]] as Blonde }} ==Production== [[Philip Yordan]] was an emerging writer who had been collaborating with George Beck. The King Brothers had a deal with [[Monogram Pictures]] and wanted Beck to write them a gangster picture but could not offer Beck's regular fee so he recommended Yordan instead. Yordan wrote ''Dillinger'', but Monogram's head of production [[Steve Broidy]] thought it would cost $50,000 and would be too expensive unless they could hire a name actor to play the lead, like [[Chester Morris]]. Yordan wanted [[Lawrence Tierney]] to play the role as ""boy he looked like Dillinger and he was mean"".<ref name=""yordan""/> He refused to see the script unless he was cast. Yordan went on to write other scripts for the King Brothers instead, ''[[The Unknown Guest (1943 film)|The Unknown Guest]]'' and ''[[When Strangers Marry]]''. Both were successful, and Tierney was cast in ''Dillinger'', which was given a decent budget.<ref name=""yordan""/> Yordan says that [[William Castle]] was meant to direct the film and he was great assistance on the script.<ref name=""yordan""/> [[Robert Tasker (author)|Robert Tasker]] also may have worked uncredited on the script.<ref>http://www.filmnoirfoundation.org/PhilipYordan.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> ==Reception== According to Philip Yordan, all the major studios had an agreement not to make movies that might glorify actual gangsters by name, but Monogram was not part of it.<ref name=""Film Noir"">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmnoirfoundation.org/PhilipYordan.pdf |title=The Phillip Yordan Story |last=Rode |first=Alan K. |website=filmnoirfoundation.org |access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> He says [[Louis B. Mayer]] asked Frank King to destroy the negative, but King refused when Mayer did not offer any compensation. Yordan says the film made $4 million of which he got a third.<ref name=""yordan""/> It is not known whether this pact actually existed. Yordan believes he should have won the Academy Award for Best Script, but that the Academy, led by [[Walter Wanger]], deliberately overlooked it in favor of ''[[Marie-Louise (film)|Marie Louise]]'', ""some picture made in Switzerland that nobody had ever seen"".<ref name=""yordan""/> Yordan also claims that ""''Dillinger'' was one of the early crime films of its type. [[Darryl F. Zanuck|Darryl Zanuck]] ran that picture again and again, and used it for the basis of many pictures at Fox. In other words, I had created a style.""<ref name=""yordan""/> ===Awards=== Yordan was nominated for the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Writing Original Screenplay]], earning [[Monogram Pictures]] its first Oscar nomination for a feature-length film release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1946 |title=1946|date= |accessdate=2019-10-18}}</ref> The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists: * 2003: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]: ** [[John Dillinger]] – Nominated Villain<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains Nominees |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}</ref> ==See also== * [[List of American films of 1945]] ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== {{Commons category}} * {{IMDb title}} * {{Amg movie}} * {{tcmdb title|id=26608}} * {{AFI film|24385}} * {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=1005864-dillinger|title=Dillinger}} * [https://archive.org/stream/variety157-1945–03#page/n71/mode/1up Review of film] at ''Variety'' {{Max Nosseck}} {{Authority control}} [[Category:1945 films]] [[Category:1940s biographical drama films]] [[Category:1945 crime drama films]] [[Category:American biographical drama films]] [[Category:American crime drama films]] [[Category:Films about John Dillinger]] [[Category:American black-and-white films]] [[Category:1940s English-language films]] [[Category:Films scored by Dimitri Tiomkin]] [[Category:Films directed by Max Nosseck]] [[Category:Films set in Indiana]] [[Category:Monogram Pictures films]] [[Category:1940s American films]]","distributor = | studio = [[Monogram Pictures]] | "

It is an adaptation of [[B. Traven]]'s 1927 [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre|novel of the same name]], set in 1925, and follows two downtrodden men (played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Tim Holt]]) who join forces with a grizzled old prospector ([[Walter Huston]], the director's father), in searching for gold in [[Mexico]]. ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' was one of the first Hollywood productions to be shot [[Filming location|on location]] outside the United States (in the state of [[Durango]] with street scenes in [[Tampico]], Mexico), although many scenes were filmed back in the studio and elsewhere in the U.S. In 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".<ref name=""1990Add"">{{cite news|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|date=October 19, 1990|access-date=July 22, 2009}}</ref> ==Plot== In 1925, in the Mexican town of [[Tampico]], labor contractor Pat McCormick recruits Fred C. Dobbs and Bob Curtin, two broke American drifters, as [[roughneck]]s to help construct oil rigs for $8 a day. When the project is completed and the men return to Tampico, McCormick skips out without paying them. The two vagrants encounter an old man named Howard in a [[flophouse]]. A loquacious ex-miner, he talks to them about gold prospecting and the perils of striking it rich. Dobbs and Curtin run into McCormick at a cantina, and collect their back wages after a bar fight. When Dobbs hits a small jackpot in the lottery, he, Curtin and Howard have enough money to buy supplies to go prospecting in the interior. Departing Tampico by train, the three help repulse a bandit attack led by ""Gold Hat"". North of [[Durango]], the trio head into the remote [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre mountains]]. Howard proves to be the hardiest and most knowledgeable of the three. After several days of arduous travel, he spots gold the others had missed. The men toil under harsh conditions and amass a fortune in [[Placer mining|placer gold]]. But as the gold piles up, Dobbs becomes increasingly distrustful of the other two. The men agree to divide the gold dust immediately and hide their shares. On a supply trip to Durango, Curtin is spotted making purchases by a Texan named Cody. Cody secretly follows Curtin back to the encampment. When he confronts the three men, they lie about what they are doing there, but he is not fooled. He boldly proposes to join their outfit and share in any future takings. Howard, Curtin and Dobbs discuss it and vote to kill him. As they announce their verdict, pistols in hand, Gold Hat and his bandits arrive. They claim to be [[Federal Police (Mexico)|''Federales'']]. After a tense parley, a gunfight ensues, and Cody is killed. A genuine troop of ''Federales'' suddenly appears and pursues Gold Hat and his gang. The three prospectors examine Cody's personal effects. A letter from a loving wife reveals that he was trying to provide for his family. Moved by the letter, Howard and Curtin agree to give part of their share to Cody's family, though Dobbs declines to do the same. Howard is called away to assist local villagers with a seriously ill little boy. When the boy recovers, the next day, the villagers insist that Howard return with them to be honored. Howard leaves his goods with Dobbs and Curtin and says he will meet them later. Dobbs and Curtin constantly argue, until one night Dobbs shoots Curtin and takes all the gold. Curtin is not dead, and manages to crawl away and hide during the night. Finding Curtin gone, Dobbs flees but is ambushed at a waterhole by Gold Hat and his men. They first toy with him, then kill him. The bandits mistake the bags of gold dust for sand and dump them, taking only the burros and supplies. The gold is scattered by the strong wind. Curtin is discovered by [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|''indios'']] and taken to Howard's village, where he recovers. Gold Hat's gang tries to sell the stolen burros in town but a child recognizes the brands on them (and Dobbs's clothes, which the bandits are wearing) and reports them to the authorities. The bandits are captured and summarily executed by the ''Federales''. Howard and Curtin return to Durango in a dust storm hoping to reclaim their gold, only to find empty bags. At first shaken by the loss, first Howard, then Curtin, grasp the immense [[irony]] of their circumstances, and burst into laughter. Howard decides to return to the village to accept an offer of a permanent home and a position of honor, while Curtin sells their recovered property to return to the U.S., where he will seek out Cody's widow. As Curtin leaves, the camera pans down to a cactus as he rides past. Lying next to it is another empty bag. ==Cast== {{cast listing| * [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Fred C.

Traven]] in 1935 and thought the material would make a great movie with his father in the main role. Based on a 19th-century ballad by a German poet, Traven's book reminded Huston of his adventures in the Mexican cavalry. After a smashing success with his directorial debut, ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', Huston started to work on the project. The studio had [[George Raft]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], and [[John Garfield]] in mind for the three main roles, but then World War II intervened. [[Vincent Sherman]] was set to direct a version of the story during the World War II years until his script fell afoul of the 1930 [[Motion Picture Production Code]] for being derogatory toward Mexicans. ===Casting=== By the time Huston came back from making several documentaries for the war effort, Humphrey Bogart had become Warner Brothers' biggest star. When Bogart first got wind that Huston might be making a film of the novel, he immediately started badgering Huston for a part. Bogart was given the main role of Fred C. Dobbs. Before filming, Bogart encountered a critic while leaving a New York nightclub. ""Wait till you see me in my next picture"", he said. ""I play the worst shit you ever saw"". [[File:Walter Huston in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre trailer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Walter Huston]] as Howard]] Traven initially disagreed with Huston's decision to cast his father, Walter Huston, as Howard, preferring [[Lewis Stone]], but eventually came to agree with Huston. Walter Huston also questioned his son's choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} He still saw himself as a leading man and was not keen on being cast in a supporting role. His son was able to convince him to accept. John Huston rated his father's performance as the finest piece of acting in any of his films.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} On seeing Walter Huston's performance, Bogart famously said, ""One Huston is bad enough, but two are murder"". Huston originally wanted to cast [[Ronald Reagan]] as James Cody. [[Jack L. Warner]] instead insisted on casting Reagan in another film. Bruce Bennett was eventually cast in the role. A few notable uncredited actors appear in the film. In an opening cameo, John Huston is pestered for money by Bogart's character, directed by Bogart. [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] also appears as a young boy selling lottery tickets.<ref name=""Maltin"">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |author-link=Leonard Maltin |title=Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F60TAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT2447 |year=2014 |publisher=Penguin Group US |isbn=978-0-14-218176-8 |page=2,447}}</ref> A photograph included in the documentary accompanying the DVD release shows [[Ann Sheridan]] in streetwalker costume, with Bogart and Huston on the set.<ref>''Discovering Treasure: The Story of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', Turner Classic Movies, 2003</ref> Many film-history sources credit Sheridan for a part.

[[File:Humphrey Bogart Walter Huston The Treasure of the Sierra Madre Still.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bruce Bennett]] (formerly ""Herman Brix""), [[Tim Holt]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Walter Huston]]]] The first scene in the film with Bogart and Holt was the first to be shot. The opening scenes, filmed in longshot on the Plaza de la Libertad in Tampico, show contemporary (1940s) cars and buses, even though the story opens in 1925, as evidenced by the lottery number's poster. Just as Huston was starting to shoot scenes in Tampico, the local government inexplicably shut the production down. The cast and crew were at a complete loss to understand, since Tampico's residents and government had so far been generous. It turned out that a local newspaper had printed a false story accusing the film of being unflattering to Mexico. Huston soon found out why the newspaper skewered his production. When you wanted to do anything in Tampico, it was customary to bribe the editor of the newspaper, which the crew had failed to do. Fortunately, two of Huston's associates, [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Miguel Covarrubias]], went to bat for the director with the president of Mexico. The libelous accusations were dropped, and a few weeks later, the editor of the newspaper was caught ''[[in flagrante delicto|in flagrante]]'' and shot dead by a jealous husband. Most of the Mexican extras were paid 10 pesos a day, the equivalent of $2, a considerable amount for an impoverished region at the time. There were scenes in which Walter Huston had to speak fluent Spanish, a language he did not know. John Huston hired a Mexican to record the lines and then the elder Huston memorized them so well that many thought he knew the language. As with most of the Mexican actors selected from the local population, [[Alfonso Bedoya]]'s heavily accented pronunciation of English proved a bit of a problem (""horseback"" sounded like ""whore's back""). Bogart knew only two Spanish words, ""Dos Equis"", a Mexican beer. The fight scene in the cantina took five days to shoot. During the shooting of the entire film, John Huston pulled pranks on Bennett, Bedoya (along with Bogart), and Bogart. While most of the film was shot in Mexico, Jack L. Warner had the unit return to Hollywood when the budget started to exceed three million dollars. Though the [[dailies]] impressed Warner Bros., Jack L. Warner nearly went berserk with the weekly expenditures. After viewing one scene, Warner threw up his hands and shouted to producer Henry Blanke, ""Yeah, they're looking for gold all right—mine!"" During another screening of dailies, Warner watched Dobbs stumble along in the desert for water. Warner jumped up in the middle of the scene and shouted to a gaggle of executives, ""If that s.o.b. doesn't find water soon I'll go broke!"". Warner had reason to be upset. John Huston and Blanke led him to believe that the film would be an easy picture to make and that they would be in and out of Mexico in a matter of weeks. Warner was notorious for not actually reading scripts and had assumed the film was a B-movie Western. As the full extent of Huston's plans became apparent, Warner became quite angry. He was especially unhappy with the way the film ended, arguing that audiences wouldn't accept it. The initial box office take was indeed unimpressive, but the film was a huge critical success and more than earned back its original investment of $3 million in its many rereleases. As production dragged on, Bogart, an avid yachtsman, was getting increasingly anxious about missing the [[Transpacific Yacht Race|Honolulu Race]] in which he usually took part. Despite assurances from the studio that his work would be done by then, he started to pester Huston about finishing in time. Eventually, Huston had enough, grabbed Bogart by the nose, and twisted hard. Bogart never again asked him to confirm when shooting was expected to be over. The windstorm in the final scene was created by jet engines borrowed from the [[Mexican Air Force]]. ===Edited scene=== Huston's original filmed depiction{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} of Dobbs's death was more graphic—as it was in the book—than the one that made it onto the screen. When Gold Hat strikes Dobbs with his machete, Dobbs is decapitated. Huston shot Dobbs's (fake) head rolling into the waterhole (a quick shot of Gold Hat's accomplices reacting to Dobbs's rolling head remains in the film, and in the very next shot one can see the water rippling where it rolled in). The 1948 censors would not allow that, so Huston camouflaged the cut shot with a repeat shot of Gold Hat striking Dobbs. Warner Bros.' publicity department released a statement that Bogart was ""disappointed the scene couldn't be shown in all its graphic glory.""{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Bogart's reaction was: ""What's wrong with showing a guy getting his head cut off?""{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} ===John Huston's screenplay=== {{main|Stinking badges}} John Huston's adaptation of Traven's novel was altered to meet [[Hays Code]] regulations, which severely limited profanity in film.<ref name=""classicfilmguide"">{{cite web |url=http://www.classicfilmguide.com/indexa620.html |title=Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The (1948) |access-date=2010-04-21 |year=2010 |publisher=classicfilmguide.com}}</ref> The original line from the novel was: :""Badges, to god-damned hell with badges!

We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!"" Gold Hat's response as written by Huston and delivered by Bedoya has become famous, and is often misquoted as ""We don't need no stinking badges!"" In 2005, the quotation was chosen as No. 36 on the [[American Film Institute]] list, [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]].

There has been controversy since the 1949 ceremony because of the academy's choice not to nominate Bogart for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], a choice that modern critics and [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] members have since condemned. Bogart's performance has been named the best of his career. British actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] said that his second Oscar-winning performance as vicious oil baron Daniel Plainview in ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'' was heavily inspired by Bogart's portrayal of Fred C. Dobbs. On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film is one of the few that have [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|an approval rating of 100%]], based on 50 reviews, and an average rating of 9.1/10.

It is based on the 1945 [[short story]] ""When Leo Comes Marching Home"" by [[Sy Gomberg]]. The film won the [[Golden Leopard]] at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]].<ref name=""Locarno"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pardo.ch/jahia/Jahia/home/Festival/History/Winners-of-the-Golden-Leopard/lang/en |title=Winners of the Golden Leopard |access-date=2012-08-12 |work=Locarno}}</ref> [[Sy Gomberg]] also received an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Motion Picture Story]] at the [[23rd Academy Awards]] in 1951 but was edged out for the award by [[Edna Anhalt]] and [[Edward Anhalt]] for ''[[Panic in the Streets (1950 film)|Panic in the Streets]]''. The film was referred to in ''M*A*S*H'' (1970), directed by Robert Altman. ==Plot== William ""Bill"" Kluggs is the first in his hometown of Punxatawney, West Virginia, to enlist in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], making his father Herman, mother Gertrude and girlfriend Marge Fettles proud. The whole town sees him off. Willie tries to become a pilot but washes out, although he proves to be so proficient at [[Aerial Gunner|aerial gunnery]] that, rather than being sent to Europe to fight, he is made an instructor and assigned to a base near his hometown. After two years in the same place, he is branded a coward by the townsfolk, even though he continually requests a transfer into combat. He finally gets his chance when a gunner on a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bomber gets sick and Bill is allowed to take his place. The plane takes off for England, but owing to fog, is unable to land and runs low on fuel. The crew is ordered to bail out, but Bill is asleep and does not parachute out of the plane until it is over German-occupied France. He is captured immediately by the local [[French Resistance]] unit, led by Yvonne. While there, he sees a secret [[V-2 rocket|German rocket]] launch, which is filmed by the Resistance. He and the film are picked up by a British [[torpedo boat]] and taken to England. There, he passes the vital information and his eyewitness confirmation on to a series of important generals, first in [[London]] and then in [[Washington, D.C.]] All this time, he is not allowed to sleep and plied with liquor as a pick-me-up or to settle [[motion sickness]]. Bill finally collapses, exhausted. He is sent to a military hospital to recuperate, under strict orders not to reveal anything. A doctor mistakenly puts him into the [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] ward. Willie escapes and heads home on a freight train. Despite his strict orders, he tells his father and girlfriend what he has accomplished. Only four days have elapsed since he left Punxatawney, and they do not believe his story. Then officers arrive to return him to Washington to be decorated personally by the [[President of the United States]]. ==Cast== * [[Dan Dailey]] as William ""Bill"" Kluggs * [[Corinne Calvet]] as Yvonne * [[Colleen Townsend]] as Marge Fettles * [[William Demarest]] as Herman Kluggs * [[Jimmy Lydon]] as Charles ""Charlie"" Fettles * [[Lloyd Corrigan]] as Major Adams * [[Evelyn Varden]] as Mrs. Gertrude Kluggs [[Mae Marsh]], formerly a successful silent-era actress, appears in an unbilled role. [[Alan Hale Jr.]] and [[Vera Miles]] also appear in unbilled roles, early in their respective careers. ==Production== Hollywood precision pilot [[Paul Mantz]] performed the crash stunt in which a [[Boeing Stearman|PT-13D Stearman]] military training aircraft shears off its wings crashing between two oak trees.<ref>Editors, ''Air Classics'', Challenge Publications, Canoga Park, California, July 1972, Volume 8, Number 8, page 39.</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== {{Commons category|When Willie Comes Marching Home (film)|When Willie Comes Marching Home}} *{{tcmdb title|id=95515}} * {{IMDb title|0043129}} {{John Ford}} {{Golden Leopard}} [[Category:1950 films]] [[Category:1950s war comedy films]] [[Category:20th Century Fox films]] [[Category:American war comedy films]] [[Category:American black-and-white films]] [[Category:Films scored by Alfred Newman]] [[Category:Films directed by John Ford]] [[Category:Golden Leopard winners]] [[Category:American World War II films]] [[Category:Films based on short fiction]] [[Category:Military humor in film]] [[Category:1950 comedy films]] [[Category:1950s English-language films]] [[Category:1950s American films]]","distributor = [[20th Century Fox]] | studio = [[20th Century Fox]] | "

However, with the advent of the automobile, his job is becoming more difficult. He considers his wife Cora demanding and an over-protective mother. When he learns his company is closing, he is unable to face her, and stops at a pharmacy to partake of ""medicinal"" alcohol. Cora is out with her daughter Reenie, buying a party dress. Rubin cannot bring himself to tell Cora he has lost his job, and they about how much Cora has spent on Reenie's dress. The couple's younger son Sonny is being bullied at school. Sonny has a fear of the dark. Determined to get him to stand up for himself, Rubin attempts to teach him to box. While sparring, he inadvertently strikes the boy too hard. An incensed Cora accuses Rubin of having an affair with Mavis Pruitt, a local widow. Rubin slaps Cora and storms out of the house. Reenie, having witnessed the row, runs into the street, causing a motorist to swerve and strike a tree. The driver, Sammy Golden, is relatively unhurt, and he and Reenie become attracted to one another. Cora calls her older sister Lottie to tell her that Rubin hit her. Rubin, still slightly intoxicated, shows up at Mavis's beauty salon, also her home, where he is seen by two town gossips. Rubin tells her Cora has ignored him for years, and while he has remained faithful, he desires Mavis. When she rejects his halfhearted advances, Rubin falls asleep on her sofa. Days later, Lottie and her husband come for dinner. Cora asks if she and the children can stay with them, then Rubin returns home to apologize. The two gossips tell Cora about Mavis, which re-ignites the argument. He accuses Cora of rejecting him sexually, and she argues that she is preoccupied with worrying about money. Reenie's friend Flirt and her boyfriend arrive, with a date for Reenie, Sammy. Lottie's bigotry is revealed when she suggests that Cora and Rubin might not want to allow Reenie to accompany a Jew to the party. Sammy and Reenie kiss at the party, but Harry Ralston and his wife berate her for bringing a Jew to the country club, where they are not allowed. Embarrassed, Sammy and Reenie leave. Sammy drops Reenie at home, where she finds Rubin on the sofa. He confesses that he has lost his job and does not know how to tell Cora. The following morning, they learn Sammy has attempted suicide. Reenie rushes to the hospital, telling him that she does not care what people think. Cora promises Sonny to stop being so over-protective so he can grow into a responsible adult, then receives a call to say that Sammy has died. She heads over to Mavis's salon, where she pretends to be a customer, before revealing that she is Rubin's wife. Mavis confesses that she has been in love with Rubin for years, but that Rubin has always been faithful to Cora, and also reveals that Rubin has lost his job. Rubin gets a new job as a salesman at an oil drilling equipment company. He returns home to find that Cora has sent Reenie to Lottie's for a few days to recover from Sammy's death. Cora and Rubin commit to paying more attention to each other's needs. As they embrace, Sonny returns home with a friend, one of his former tormentors from school. Rubin pays for the two boys to go to a movie, then follows his wife up to the bedroom. ==Cast== * [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] as Rubin Flood * [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Cora Flood * [[Eve Arden]] as Lottie Lacey * [[Angela Lansbury]] as Mavis Pruitt * [[Shirley Knight]] as Reenie Flood * [[Lee Kinsolving]] as Sammy Golden * [[Frank Overton]] as Morris Lacey * Robert Eyer as Sonny Flood * Penney Parker as Flirt Conroy * [[Ken Lynch]] as Harry Ralston * [[Paul Birch (actor)|Paul Birch]] as Jonah Mills (uncredited) * [[Peg LaCentra]] as Edna Harper (uncredited) * [[Nelson Leigh]] as Ed Peabody (uncredited) * [[Charles Seel]] as Percy Weems (uncredited) * Mary Patton as Mrs Ralston (uncredited) ==Production== Warner Bros. announced in January 1960 that it would be producing a film version of Inge's play, directed by Delbert Mann and starring Robert Preston and Dorothy McGuire.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=Film Bulletin | title=This Is Your Product | date=January 18, 1960 | page=27 | url=https://archive.org/stream/filmbulletin196028film#page/n55/mode/2up/search/%22Dark+at+the+Top+of+the+Stairs%22|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}</ref> During rehearsals for the production, Mann used the same process that he had used since his first film, ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', in 1955.

It is based on the novel of the same name by [[B. Traven]], loosely based in an old border legend, set in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (modern-day [[Mexico]]). It was the first Mexican film to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref name=""Oscars1961"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1961 |title=The 33rd Academy Awards (1961) Nominee and Winners |accessdate=2011-10-29|work=oscars.org}}</ref> Additionally, it was also entered into the [[1960 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=""festival-cannes.com"">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3323/year/1960.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Macario |accessdate=2009-02-15|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> ''Macario'' has been widely regarded by critics and audiences as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest Mexican films ever made]]. ==Plot== [[File:Pina Pellicer in Macario (1960) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pina Pellicer]] photographed for the film. She plays Macario's wife]] The story centers on Macario, a poor Indigenous woodcutter, during Colonial [[Mexico]], on the eve of the [[Day of the Dead]], who lives embittered for being so poor and hungry. His economic situation keeps him and his family at the edge of starvation. After he sees a procession of roast [[Turkey as food|turkeys]], his dream is to eat a whole roast turkey just by himself. He announces in front of his wife and children that he will not eat until his dream comes true. His worried wife steals a turkey and gives it to Macario before he heads to the mountains to work. However, just as Macario prepares to eat the turkey, three men appear to him. The first one is the Devil in the guise of a fine gentleman, who tempts Macario in order to get a piece of the turkey. The second one is God in the guise of an old man. Macario refuses to share the turkey with either, since he believes that they both have the means necessary to get themselves what they want. When a third figure —a peasant like himself— appears to him, he gladly shares the turkey with the man. The third man is none other than [[Death (personification)|Death]] itself. Death is unsure why Macario has shared his turkey with him and not with the [[Devil]] and [[God]]. Macario responds, ""Whenever you appear, there is no time for anything else."" Macario hoped to forestall what he assumed to be his imminent death by gaining the time it would take for him and Death to eat. Death is amused and as a compensation, names Macario his ""friend"" and gives him miraculous water that will heal any disease. If Death appears at the feet of the sick person, they can be healed with the water - but if Death appears by the person's head he or she is condemned to die. This ""friendship"" lasts for years, but they never speak to each other, but merely stare. Death hints that Macario will meet him later that day. Macario returns home to find his son unconscious and badly injured from falling into a well. Macario heals his son with the water and eventually becomes known as a miraculous healer, creating such commotion that the church itself will accuse him of heresy, and even the Viceroy will ask for his services, to cure his son. He is promised freedom if he can save the boy, or to be burned at the stake otherwise. [[File:GrutasCacahuamilpa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grutas de Cacahuamilpa National Park|Grutas de Cacahuamilpa]], the place used for filming the ""Death's cavern""]] Unfortunately for Macario, Death ""has to take the child,"" so Macario, in despair, begs and tries to escape, only to enter Death's cavern and is reprimanded for turning his ""gift"" into merchandise. Death shows him the candles that the cavern is filled with, thousands of candles all representing a person's life. The making of the wax and length of the candle all factor into the lifespan of a given person. Death then snuffs out the candle of the Viceroy's son before Macario's eyes. When Macario sees how short his candle is, he begs Death to save it but Death refuses. In desperation, Macario snatches up his candle and runs out of the cavern, not heeding the shouts of Death behind him. The last scenes begin at twilight on the day that Macario shared the turkey with Death. He has not come home, and his wife and some villagers are looking for Macario out in the woods only to find him peacefully dead, next to a turkey divided in halves: one of which is eaten, the other being intact, as if he died not fulfilling his dream of eating a complete turkey for himself. ==Cast== {{multiple image | total_width= 250 | header = Lead actors of the film | image1 = Pina Pellicer (1961) (cropped).jpg | image2 = López Tarso 2015 (cropped).jpg | footer = [[Pina Pellicer]] (in 1961) and [[Ignacio López Tarso]] (in 2015) }} *[[Ignacio López Tarso]] as Macario *[[Pina Pellicer]] as Macario's wife *[[Enrique Lucero]] as Death *Mario Alberto Rodríguez as Don Ramiro *Enrique García Álvarez as Member of the Inquisition *[[Eduardo Fajardo]] as Viceroy *José Gálvez as The Devil *José Luis Jiménez as God ===Comparison to novel=== The film is adapted from the story ""[[The Third Guest]]"" by [[B.

It recounts, within the context of the turmoil of war, various kinds of love: the romantic love of a young couple, the committed love of a married couple, and a mother's love of her child, as a [[Red Army]] soldier tries to make it home during a leave, meeting several civilians on his way and falling in love. The film was produced at [[Mosfilm]] and won several awards, including the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award for Best Film From Any Source]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. ==Plot== A middle-aged farm woman walks through her village and gazes down a country road. A voiceover reveals that her son was killed in the war and buried in a foreign land. On the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], nineteen-year-old Private Alyosha Skvortsov (Vladimir Ivashov) single-handedly destroys two attacking [[Nazi Germany|German]] tanks, more out of self-preservation than bravery. His commanding general wants to give him a decoration, but Alyosha asks instead for a leave to see his mother and to repair the leaking roof of their home. He is given six days. During his journey, he sees the devastation the war has wrought on the country and meets various people. When the jeep Alyosha is riding gets stuck in the mud, Private Pavlov helps push it out. As Alyosha will be passing through his home city, Pavlov persuades him to take a present to Pavlov's wife. Pavlov's sergeant reluctantly parts with two bars of soap, the entire supply for their platoon. At the train station, Alyosha helpfully carries the suitcase of Vasya, a soldier discharged because he has lost a leg. Vasya does not want to go home, as he would be a burden to his wife, and their relationship had already been troubled. However, he changes his mind and is welcomed with open arms by the loving woman. When he attempts to board a freight car of an army supply train, Alyosha is stopped by Gavrilkin, a sentry. However, a bribe of a can of beef eases Gavrilkin's fear of his lieutenant, a ""beast"". Shura ([[Zhanna Prokhorenko]]) later sneaks aboard as well, but when she sees him, she becomes frightened and tries to jump off the speeding train. Alyosha stops her from risking her life. She tells him she is going to see her fiancé, a pilot who is recuperating in a hospital. As the days pass, she loses her fear and mistrust of him. Gavrilkin spots the civilian stowaway, forcing Alyosha to bribe him anew. When the lieutenant discovers the unauthorized passengers, he lets them remain aboard and even makes Gavrilkin return the bribe. At one stop, Alyosha gets out to fetch some water, but the train leaves without him. Frantic, he gets a lift to the next station from an old woman truck driver. He is too late; the train has already departed. However, Shura got off and is waiting for him. The couple then go to see Pavlov's wife. They discover that she is living with another man and leave. Alyosha returns, takes back the soap he had given her, and gives it instead to Pavlov's invalid father. When they finally part, Shura confesses she lied; there was no fiancé, only an aunt. Alyosha realizes too late, after his train departs, that when Shura said she had no one, she was telling him that she loves him. His train is stopped by a blown-up bridge and set on fire by German bombers. With time running out, Alyosha rafts across the river and persuades another truck driver to give him a ride to his rural village, Sosnovka. He gets to see his mother only for a few minutes before having to make his way back to his unit. His mother vows to wait for him. The voiceover tells us that while he could have gone far in life if he had lived, he will always be remembered simply as a Russian soldier. ==Cast== * [[Vladimir Ivashov]] as Private Alyosha Skvortsov * [[Zhanna Prokhorenko]] as Shura * [[Antonina Maksimova]] as Alyosha's mother * [[Nikolai Kryuchkov]] as the general * [[Yevgeni Urbansky]] as Vasya * [[Elza Lezhdey]] as Vasya's wife * Aleksandr Kuznetsov as Gavrilkin * [[Yevgeni Teterin]] as The lieutenant * Valentina Markova as Liza (Pavlov's wife) * Marina Kremnyova as Zoya (neighbor girl) * Vladimir Pokrovsky as Pavlov's invalid father * [[Georgi Yumatov]] as Sergeant giving bars of soap * [[Gennadi Yukhtin]] as Private Seryozha Pavlov * [[Valentina Telegina]] as Old woman truck driver * [[Lev Borisov]] as Joking soldier on train *[[Yevgeny Yevstigneyev]] as Truck driver The two lead actors, Ivashov and Prokhorenko, were both only nineteen years old and did not have much acting experience. Grigory Chukhray commented on his casting choice: <blockquote>We took a big risk. It was risky to give the main roles to quite inexperienced actors. Not many would have done so in those times, but we ventured and did not regret afterwards. Volodya and Zhanna gave the most precious colouring to the film, that is, the spontaneity and charm of youth.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ivanova | first = Vera | title = Ballad of a Film-Director: Grigorii Chukhrai | publisher = Russia-IC.com | date = April 27, 2006 | url = http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/theatre/172/ | access-date = 2008-04-13| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080312225857/http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/theatre/172/| archive-date= 12 March 2008 | url-status= live}} </ref></blockquote> Both would go on to long careers in cinema. ==Production== According to [[Robert Osborne]], the primary host of [[Turner Classic Movies]], Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was a fan of the director, so Chukray was given more leeway than normal. ==Reception== ''Ballad of a Soldier'' was released on December 1, 1959 in the Soviet Union and sold 30.1 million tickets at screenings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zemlianukhin|first=Sergei|author2=Miroslava Segida|title=Domashniaia sinemateka 1918&ndash;1996 (Домашняя Синематека 1918&ndash;1996)|publisher=Duble-D|location=Moscow|year=1996|isbn= 5-900902-05-6|language=ru|page=420}}</ref> The film was released in the United States in 1960 as part of a Soviet-American film exchange during a [[Khrushchev Thaw|thaw]] in the [[Cold War]].

The film is loosely based on the life of the 11th-century [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] warlord [[El Cid|Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar]], called ""El Cid"" (from the Arabic [[sidi|al-sidi]], meaning ""The Lord""). The film stars [[Charlton Heston]] in the title role and [[Sophia Loren]] as [[Jimena Díaz|Doña Jimena]], spelled ""Chimene"" in the script and pronounced that way (shim-ain) in the film. The screenplay is credited to [[Fredric M. Frank]], [[Philip Yordan]] and [[Ben Barzman]], with uncredited contributions by [[Bernard Gordon (writer)|Bernard Gordon]]. ''El Cid'' premiered on December 6, 1961 at the Metropole Theatre in London, and was released on December 14 in the United States. The film received largely positive reviews praising the performances of Heston and Loren, the cinematography, and the musical score. It went on to gross $26.6 million during its initial theatrical run. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. ==Plot== General [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin|Ben Yusuf]] of the [[Almoravid dynasty]] has summoned all the [[emir]]s of [[Al-Andalus]] to North Africa. He chastises them for co-existing peacefully with their Christian neighbors, which goes against his dream of Islamic world domination. The emirs return to Spain with orders to resume hostilities with the Christians while Ben Yusuf readies his army for a full-scale invasion. Don Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, on the way to his wedding with [[Jimena Díaz|Doña Chimene]], rescues a Spanish town from an invading [[Moors|Moorish]] army. Two of the emirs, [[Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud|al-Mu'tamin]] of [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]] and [[Yahya al-Qadir|al-Kadir]] of [[Taifa of Valencia|Valencia]], are captured. More interested in peace than in wreaking vengeance, Rodrigo escorts his prisoners to Vivar and releases them on condition that they never again attack lands belonging to [[Ferdinand I of León and Castile|King Ferdinand of Castile]]. The Emirs proclaim him ""El Cid"" (Castilian Spanish for the Arabic for [[milord]]: ""al-[[Sidi]]"") and swear allegiance to him. For his act of mercy, Don Rodrigo is accused of treason by [[García Ordóñez|Count Ordóñez]]. In court, the charge is supported by Chimene's father, Count Gormaz, the king's champion. Rodrigo's aged father, Don Diego, angrily calls Gormaz a liar. Gormaz strikes Don Diego, challenging him to a [[duel]]. At a private meeting Rodrigo begs Gormaz to ask the aged but proud Diego for forgiveness (for accusing Rodrigo of treason). Gormaz refuses, so Rodrigo fights the duel on Diego’s behalf and kills his opponent. Chimene witnesses the death of Gormaz and swears to avenge him, renouncing her affection for Rodrigo. When the [[King of Aragon]] demands the city of [[Calahorra]] from Castile, Rodrigo becomes Ferdinand's champion, winning the city in single combat. In his new capacity he is sent on a mission to collect tribute from Moorish vassals to the Castilian crown. He asks that Chimene be given to him as his wife upon his return, so that he can provide for her. Chimene promises Count Ordóñez she will marry him instead if he kills Rodrigo. Ordóñez lays an ambush for Rodrigo and his men but is captured by al-Mu'tamin, to whom Rodrigo had earlier showed mercy. Rodrigo forgives the Count and returns home to marry Chimene. The marriage is not consummated: Rodrigo will not touch her if she does not give herself to him out of love. Chimene instead goes to a convent. King Ferdinand dies and his younger son, [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Prince Alfonso]] tells the elder son [[Sancho II of León and Castile|Prince Sancho]] that their father wanted his kingdom divided between his heirs: Castile to Sancho, Asturias and León to Alfonso, and Calahorra to their sister, [[Urraca of Zamora|Princess Urraca]]. Sancho refuses to accept anything but an undivided kingdom as his birthright. After Alfonso instigates a knife fight, Sancho overpowers his brother and sends him to be imprisoned in Zamora. Rodrigo, who swore to protect all the king’s children, single-handedly defeats Alfonso's guards and brings the Prince to Calahorra. Sancho arrives to demand Alfonso, but Urraca refuses to hand him over. Rodrigo cannot take a side in the conflict, because his oath was to serve them all equally. Ben Yusuf arrives at Valencia, the fortified city guarding the beach where he plans to land his armada. To weaken his Spanish opponents he hires Dolfos, a warrior formerly trusted by Ferdinand, to assassinate Sancho and throw suspicion for the crime on Alfonso, who becomes the sole king. At Alfonso's coronation, El Cid has him swear upon the Bible that he had no part in the death of his brother. Alfonso, genuinely innocent (although his ally Urraca was aware of the plot), is offended by the demand and banishes Rodrigo from Spain. Chimene discovers she still loves Rodrigo and voluntarily joins him in exile. Rodrigo makes his career as a soldier elsewhere in Spain, and he and Chimene have twin girls. Years later, Rodrigo, now known widely as ""El Cid"", is called back into the service of the king to protect Castile from Yusuf's North African army. However, Alfonso rejects an alliance with El Cid's Muslim friends, and rather than work directly with the king, El Cid allies himself with the emirs to besiege Valencia, where the cowardly al-Kadir has violated his oath of allegiance to Rodrigo and come out in support of Ben Yusuf. After being defeated by the Moors at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]], Alfonso seizes Chimene and her children and puts them in prison. Count Ordóñez rescues the three and brings them to Rodrigo, wanting to end his rivalry with El Cid and join him in the defense of Spain. Knowing that the citizens of Valencia are starving after the long siege, Rodrigo wins them over by throwing bread into the city with his catapults. Al-Kadir tries to intercede, but the Valencians kill him and open the gates to the besiegers. Emir al-Mu'tamin, Rodrigo's army, and the Valencians offer the city's crown to El Cid, but he refuses and instead sends the crown to King Alfonso. Ben Yusuf arrives with his immense invasion army, and Valencia is the only barrier between him and Spain. Ordóñez is tortured and killed after being captured on a reconnaissance mission. The ensuing battle goes well for the defenders until El Cid is struck in the chest by an arrow and has to return to the city in plain sight of the Moorish army. Doctors inform him that they can probably remove the arrow and save his life, but he will be incapacitated for a long time after the surgery. Unwilling to abandon his army at this critical moment, Rodrigo obtains a promise from Chimene to leave the arrow and let him ride back into battle, dying or dead. A guilt-ridden King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness. Rodrigo grants it, and Alfonso promises to look after Rodrigo's children. Rodrigo dies, and a rumor of his death spreads. His allies honor Rodrigo's final wish. With help of an iron frame they prop up his body, its eyes staring straight ahead. Dressed in full armor and holding an unfurled banner, he is strapped to the back of his horse, Babieca.

Mexican ''[[rurales]]'' (mounted police) catch them celebrating in a cantina and kill Doc. Dad and Rio escape, but Dad leaves Rio to be taken by the ''rurales''. Rio is arrested and spends five hard years in a Sonora prison. He escapes and travels to [[Monterey, California]], where Dad has become [[sheriff]]. Rio plans to kill Dad and rob the bank in Monterey with his new partners Chico Modesto and Bob Emory. Plans are sidetracked when Rio falls in love with Dad's beautiful stepdaughter, Louisa. Rio takes advantage of a ''fiesta'' (festival) to spend the night with her on the beach. Dad tries to punish Louisa for what happened, but backs down after intervention by his wife, Maria. Instead, he traps Rio, whips him in public, and smashes his gun hand to make sure Rio will never be able to beat him in a gunfight. While recovering from his wounds, Rio struggles with his conflicting desires to love the girl and to get revenge on her stepfather. He decides to forgo vengeance, fetch Louisa, and leave town. Emory and a partner kill Chico and pull off the bank job without Rio's knowledge. The heist goes wrong and a young girl is killed. Dad accuses Rio of the crime. Dad has one last private talk with Rio, again attempting to absolve himself for all he has done. Rio replies, ""You're a one-eyed jack around here, Dad, but I've seen the other side of your face"". Rio tells him he had been imprisoned for the last five years, but Dad calls it a lie. [[File:One-Eyed Jacks 1961 (1).jpg|thumb|Louisa (Pina Pellicer) visits Rio (Marlon Brando) in jail]] Louisa visits Rio in jail to tell him she is going to have his baby. He is then beaten by sadistic deputy Lon Dedrick, who desired and has been denied Louisa's affection. Maria confronts Dad and insists on being told the truth about the relationship between him and Rio, stating she knew something was wrong since the moment Rio arrived. She says she knows Dad wants to hang him purely out of guilt. Dad tells her she has no appreciation for everything he has done for her. Louisa attempts to smuggle a [[Derringer]] to Rio, but she is discovered by Dedrick, who carries her out of the jail, leaving the gun on a table. While they are out, Rio is able to get hold of the pistol. Pointing the unloaded gun at Dedrick when he returns, Rio bluffs his way out of jail in a tense confrontation. Rio takes Dedrick's revolver, beats him unconscious, and locks him in a cell. As Rio is making his escape, he is spotted by Dad, riding into town. Under fire, in the final showdown Rio shoots Dad dead. Rio and Louisa ride out to the dunes and say a sentimental farewell. Now a hunted man, Rio tells Louisa that he might go to [[Oregon]], but will return for her in the spring. ==Cast== {{Cast listing| * [[Marlon Brando]] as Rio * [[Pina Pellicer]] as Louisa Longworth * [[Karl Malden]] as Dad Longworth * [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Bob Emory * [[Katy Jurado]] as Maria Longworth * [[Slim Pickens]] as Lon Dedrick * [[Larry Duran]] as Chico Modesto * [[Sam Gilman]] as Harvey Johnson * [[Timothy Carey]] as Howard Tetley * [[Míriam Colón]] as Redhead * [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as Carvey * [[Rodolfo Acosta]] as Mexican Rurale Captain * Tom Webb as Farmer's Son * [[Ray Teal]] as Barney * [[John Dierkes]] as Chet * [[Philip Ahn]] as Uncle * [[Margarita Cordova]] as Nika, Flamenco Dancer * [[Hank Worden]] as Doc }} ==Adaptation and development== {{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}} [[Rod Serling]], creator of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' television series, wrote an adaptation of the 1956 novel ''The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones'' by [[Charles Neider]], at the request of producer Frank P. Rosenberg. The book was a fictional treatment of the familiar [[Billy the Kid]] story, relocated from [[New Mexico]] to the [[Monterey Peninsula]] in [[California]]. The adaptation was rejected. Rosenberg next hired [[Sam Peckinpah]], who finished his first script on 11 November 1957. Marlon Brando's Pennebaker Productions had paid $40,000 for the rights to ''Authentic Death'' and then signed a contract with [[Stanley Kubrick]] to direct for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Peckinpah handed in a revised screenplay on 6 May 1959. Brando later fired Peckinpah and hired [[Calder Willingham]] to further revise the film's script, but he too was eventually fired. [[Guy Trosper]] was brought on as a final replacement. Additionally, Stanley Kubrick—for unknown reasons—stepped down from directing the film just two weeks before starting production.<ref name=""1966 Kubrick Interview by Jeremy Bernstein"">{{cite web |last1=Bernstein |first1=Jeremy |title=Stanley Kubrick 1966 Interview |url=https://youtube.com/OQOMNF27kLg?t=2432 |website=YouTube |access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref> Brando volunteered to direct in his stead. The movie ultimately bore little resemblance to the Neider novel, and what remains has much more resonance with history than fiction. At various times, the two credited screenwriters and the uncredited Peckinpah have claimed (or had claimed for them) a majority of the responsibility for the film. When [[Karl Malden]] was asked who really wrote the story, he said: ""There is one answer to your question—Marlon Brando, a genius in our time.""<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.towntopics.com/jul0809/book.php| title= Karl Malden and Marlon Brando in One-Eyed Jacks: ""We Had the Very Best of Each Other""| first=Stuart|last= Mitchner| date= July 8, 2009| publisher= [[Town Topics (newspaper)|Town Topics]]| location= Princeton, New Jersey | access-date=2014-02-16}}</ref> ==Production== [[File:Pina Pellicer and Marlon Brando publicity photo (1961).jpg|thumb|Pina Pellicer and Marlon Brando behind the scenes of the film]] The film was [[Paramount Pictures]]' last feature released in [[VistaVision]].

It was based on the 1891 American short story [[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|of the same name]] by [[American Civil War]] soldier, wit, and writer [[Ambrose Bierce]]. It was directed by [[Robert Enrico]] and produced by [[Marcel Ichac]] and Paul de Roubaix with music by Henri Lanoë. It won awards at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Academy Awards]]. The film was later screened on American television as episode 22 of the [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series, season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' on 28 February 1964. ==Plot== A handbill posted on a burnt tree, dated 1862, announces that anyone interfering with bridges, railroads or tunnels will be summarily executed. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops prepare a civilian prisoner, Peyton Farquhar, for death by [[hanging]] from a rural railroad bridge. The soundtrack contains only bird noises and brief military orders. As the rope is adjusted about Farquhar's neck, a vision of his home, wife and children flashes before him. As Farquhar falls, the rope breaks, and he drops into the river. In an underwater sequence he frees himself from his bonds, kicks his boots free and swims downstream as soldiers fire at him. Farquhar is swept through rapids and crawls ashore exhausted but laughing with relief. Glimpses of tree branches, sky and crawling insects are interrupted by a distant cannon shot which sends him running through a forest, then along a linear and orderly lane. Finally arriving at the gates of his home, he pushes his way through foliage. Farquhar reaches open lawn and runs toward his wife as she walks toward him, smiling and weeping. Just as the couple are about to fall into each other's arms, Farquhar stiffens and gasps, and his head snaps back. The scene cuts back to his body hanging from the bridge, his entire escape and reunion with his wife revealed to be an illusion experienced in the moment of the drop. ==''Twilight Zone'' airing== Three years after its production, the film was shown on American TV slightly shortened on February 28, 1964 as part of season 5 of the [[fantasy]]/[[science fiction]] show ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''. Producer [[William Froug]] had seen the film and decided to buy the rights to broadcast it on American television. The episode's introduction is notable for [[Rod Serling]] breaking the [[fourth wall]] even more than usual, as he explains how the film was shot overseas and later picked up to air as part of ''The Twilight Zone''. The introduction by Rod Serling is as follows: {{blockquote|Tonight, a presentation so special and unique that for the first time in the five years we've been presenting ''The Twilight Zone,'' we're offering a film shot in France by others. Winner of the Cannes Film Festival of 1962, as well as other international awards, here is a haunting study of the incredible from the past master of the incredible, Ambrose Bierce. Here is the French production of ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""}} Serling's closing narration states: {{blockquote|An occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, in two forms: as it was dreamed&nbsp;... and as it was lived and died. This is the stuff of fantasy, the thread of imagination&nbsp;... the ingredients of the Twilight Zone.}} The transaction cost ''The Twilight Zone'' $25,000, significantly less than the average of $65,000 they expended on producing their own episodes; however, Froug's purchase allowed for the film to be aired only twice. Consequently, it is not included on ''The Twilight Zone's'' syndication package,{{dubious|Only broadcast twice?|date=January 2023}} though it is included with the series on home video releases. [[Marc Scott Zicree]]'s ''The Twilight Zone Companion'' incorrectly states the French film was purchased for $10,000. This mistake has been reprinted in a number of books since the 1984 publication. ''The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic'' by Martin Grams correctly verifies the purchase price as $20,000 plus $5,000 additional costs for re-editing. According to Zicree, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" was the last episode of the classic ''Twilight Zone'' to be ""produced"" (presumably referencing the re-editing and the addition of footage of Rod Serling, as production of the series was cancelled afterwards). It was not, however, the last episode of the series to be broadcast. ==Awards== * [[1962 Cannes Film Festival]]: Best Short Subject * 1963 [[Academy Award]], [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Action Short Film]]<ref name=""NY Times"">{{cite web |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/35918/An-Occurrence-at-Owl-Creek-Bridge/details |title= An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge |access-date= 2008-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081023123313/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/35918/An-Occurrence-at-Owl-Creek-Bridge/details |department= Movies & TV Dept. |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 2008 |archive-date= 2008-10-23 }}</ref> ==Preservation== ''An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge'' was preserved by the [[Academy Film Archive]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=https://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=an+occurrence&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} *{{cite book|last=Zicree|first=Marc Scott|title=The Twilight Zone Companion|year=1982|publisher=Bantam|location=New York|isbn=0-553-01416-1}} *Barrett, Gerald R.

The film begins with a young man (whose only line, repeated four times, is ""Help!"") sitting patiently in a hospital bed. An unidentified [[Physician|doctor]] enters the room and checks the man's heart rate, which begins to pulse rhythmically. As the rhythm increases, the film begins to follow the man's daily habits such as crossing a busy street, in different clothes and different locations, working in a busy office, working on a conveyor belt, walking through different locations and ending up in a forest where he has the appearance of [[Tarzan]], eating dinner with his wife, walking down the street seeing pogo stick riders, and visiting a [[strip club]] while simultaneously maintaining himself in motion. Eventually, the man is imprisoned for shooting the [[Mona Lisa]] while intoxicated (signified by a scene of him painting an elephant [[Seeing pink elephants|pink]]) and dressed as a [[cowboy]] and is forced to perform acts of labor like working in the rock pile. The man eventually escapes from prison and begins to frantically run across a long distance with different disguises like a man in a [[top hat]] and [[Tarzan]] while evading cowboys. The man then jumps off a diving board and soars into the sky (aided by a flying device) where he is subsequently shot down by the world's military powers. He falls from the sky defeated and lands in a muddy puddle in the form of a rustic clock. The clock [[Striking clock|strikes twelve]] and the film's events flash quickly on-screen. Back in the hospital room, the doctor covers the man's seemingly lifeless body.

The film was written by [[Larry Cohen]] and directed by [[Burt Kennedy]], and features [[Warren Oates]], [[Claude Akins]], [[Jordan Christopher]] and [[Virgilio Teixeira (actor)|Virgilio Teixeira]]. [[Emilio Fernández]] is the villain. [[Fernando Rey]] portrays a priest. Rey was in the next film, ''[[Guns of the Magnificent Seven]]'', as a different character. ==Plot== Fifty gunmen force all of the men in a small Mexican village to ride off with them into the desert. Among the captured farmers is Chico, who years before was one of seven hired gunslingers responsible for ridding the village of a tyrannical bandit, Calvera. Chico's wife, Petra, seeks out the only other members of the band to survive: Chris and Vin. She begs them to save the village once more. To replace the deceased members of the group, Chris buys the release of Frank (a taciturn gunman) and Luis (a famous bandit), held in the local jail and recruits Colbee, a ladies' man and deadly gunman, and Manuel, a young [[cockfight]]er. The six men discover that the missing villagers are being used as slave labor to rebuild a desert village and church as a memorial to the dead sons of wealthy rancher Lorca. In a surprise attack, the six gunmen force Lorca's men to leave, and prepare for a counterattack with Chico. The cowed farmers offer no assistance, but the seven defenders successfully repulse Lorca's initial attack. Lorca, the rancher, then gathers all of the men on his land to rout the seven men. The situation seems bleak until Manuel discovers a supply of dynamite which the seven use in a counteroffensive. They are eventually overrun, but Chris emerges victorious from a shootout with Lorca. The rancher's gang flee, leaving Frank, Luis, and Manuel dead in the fighting. Chico plans to resettle the village on Lorca's fertile land, and Colbee remains to help teach the villagers how to defend themselves against future attacks; he also plans to pursue the available women. Chris and Vin once more ride off together. ==Cast== ===The Seven=== * [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Chris Adams (character)|Chris Adams]] * [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]] as Vin Tanner * [[Julián Mateos]] as Chico * [[Warren Oates]] as Colbee * [[Claude Akins]] as Frank * [[Virgilio Teixeira (actor)|Virgilio Teixeira]] as Luis Emilio Delgado * [[Jordan Christopher]] as Manuel De Norte ===Others=== * [[Elisa Montés]] as Petra, Chico's wife * [[Fernando Rey]] as Priest * [[Emilio Fernández]] as Francisco Lorca * [[Rodolfo Acosta]] as Lopez (credited as Rudy Acosta) * Gracita Sacromonte as Flamenco Dancer * [[Carlos Casaravilla]] as First Peon * [[Ricardo Palacios]] as Jailer * Felisa Jiminez as Female Prisoner * Pedro Bermudez as Boy * Francisco Antón as Matador * Moises Menendez as Second Peon * Hector Quiroga as Third Peon * Jose Talavera as Fourth Peon ==Production== The film was shot in Spain.<ref name=varrev/> ==Reception== ''Return of the Seven'' was critically panned.

It was re-released on Southern Cross Records on CD.

This forces them and thousands of refugees to begin a trek northward through the Bosnian Mountains. Their goal is to reach the bridge at Neretva in order to escape. Their trip is fraught with danger every step of the way and they have to face German tanks, Italian infantry, Chetnik Cavalry, strafing airplanes, disease and natural elements. ==Cast== {{castlist| * [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] as Martin * [[Yul Brynner]] as Vlado ([[Vladimir Smirnov (Yugoslav general)|Vladimir Smirnov]]) * [[Curt Jürgens]] as Gen.

It had a staggering budget approved by Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Different sources put it anywhere between $4.5 million and $12 million. Global stars such as [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Yul Brynner]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Orson Welles]], etc. flocked to communist Yugoslavia attracted by the huge sums of money being offered. Shot over 16 months with funds put up in largest part by over 58 self-managed companies in Yugoslavia, the movie featured a combined battalion of 10,000 [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) soldiers. Four villages and a fortress were constructed for the film and destroyed. Several JNA-inventory Soviet [[T-34]] tanks, touched up to look like German [[Panzer III|Panzers]], met the same fate. Even used several Yugoslavian planes [[Soko 522]] like germans luftwaffe planes with [[Balkenkreuz]] on the wings. A railway bridge over the [[Neretva]] in [[Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jablanica]] was destroyed.<ref>Location of the Neretva Bridge {{nowrap|{{coord|43.654|N|17.762|E|scale:5000|name=Location of the Neretva Bridge}}}}</ref> Director Bulajić's justification for demolishing the bridge rather than getting the shots in studio was that it would become a tourist attraction. The bridge was thus blown but because none of the footage was usable due to the billowing smoke that made it impossible to see anything, it was decided that the bridge should be repaired and destroyed again. The problem with the excessive smoke occurred again and the scenes of the bridge being blown up in the film were shot using a table-size replica at a sound stage in [[Prague]].<ref name=""Robna kuća: Bitka na Neretvi""/> The Yugoslav public was updated on the shooting progress via pieces in the country's print media.<ref>[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2013/04/kako-je-snimana-bitka-na-neretvi-1-deo.html Glumci na služenju vojske!];''Plavi vjesnik'', July 1968</ref><ref>[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2013/04/kako-je-snimana-bitka-na-neretvi-2-deo.html Najveći honorari Bati i Ljubiši!];''Plavi vjesnik'', July 1968</ref> ==Release== The film has been edited in to numerous versions. Runtimes vary by location, the regional prints also change the story due to edits that add or remove scenes: * North America: 106 minutes * Spanish: 113 minutes * European: 127 minutes * UK/Australia: 127 minutes * Germany and Croatia: 142 minutes each, although they are not the same print. * Serbia: 160 minutes Most of the actors spoke their native language and subtitled in the original release. Afterwards the film was dubbed in English and distributed world-wide with subtitles for some scenes. The English dubbed versions, running between 106 and 127 minutes, were rescored by [[Bernard Hermann]] as the original film score by Vladmir Kraus Rajteric had been damaged in the redubbing process. However, the German and Croat-language releases contain the original score.<ref>{{cite book|ISBN= 9780810883987|year= 2013|publisher= Scarecrow Press|first=Laurence E.|last= MacDonald |title=The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History|page=255}}</ref> ==Reception== [[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Sergei Bondarchuk and Orson Welles, Sarajevo, 29. november 1969.

He lives with his parents Harry and Annie and his grandfather Zaida, a [[rag-and-bone man]] who collects rags and bottles on his horse, Ferdeleh, and wagon—while also studying the [[Talmud]] and claiming it as the only book he has read. David loves riding with his grandfather, and shares Zaida's love for his Ferdeleh, despite the horse's age and the neighbour Mrs. Tannenbaum's complaints as to the smell. Zaida jokes about covering Mrs. Tannenbaum's steps with horse excrement, an idea that delights David, who takes it seriously. While Zaida's friend Mr. Baumgarten embraces the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] to end [[social class]] injustice, Zaida replies he is instead looking to [[Messiah in Judaism|the arrival of the messiah]] to end all injustice. Harry, who is not religious, designs a pair of trousers meant to be impossible to crease, and appeals to Zaida for $500 in investment, claiming he already has many orders for the product and will be able to pay back with interest in one month. When Harry demonstrates his ""pressless trousers"", his own business partner points out the bulges in the knees, spoiling any chance Zaida will invest. Enraged, Harry rants about marrying into an unintelligent family, condemns Zaida as a [[miser]] and not a real [[Orthodox Jew]], and says Ferdeleh should be killed. David overhears these threats made by his father and is disturbed and embarrassed for the way he has spoken of his family, particularly Zaida. In attempt to comfort his grandfather, David informs Zaida that his father tells ""terrible lies"". While David hopes to ride with Zaida on another Sunday, Harry insists instead on taking David [[fishing]]. However, Harry actually takes David to a gambling club, and talks of leaving the ghetto behind. With orders on the defective trousers cancelled, Harry goes into bankruptcy and the family's plans to move are cancelled, to David's joy. Annie gives birth to David's baby brother, and David becomes jealous his brother gets to [[breastfeed]]. Finally disillusioned with the deceptions of all adults, David covers Mrs. Tannenbaum's steps with horse excrement. The police arrive and discover Zaida's stable is in violation of bylaws requiring stables to be located 100 yards from residences. The police give Zaida 30 days to move it, but he resolves not to. He instead becomes gravely ill, and David is sent to his uncle to avoid a spread of the illness. When he returns, Harry tells David that Zaida and Ferdeleh have both died. Distressed, David runs from home and imagines his grandfather returning. ==Cast== * [[Yossi Yadin]] as Zaida * [[Len Birman]] as Harry Herman * [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Annie Herman * [[Jeffery Lynas]] as David Herman * [[Ted Allan]] as Mr. Baumgarten * [[Henry Gamer]] as Uncle Benny * [[Barbara Chilcott]] as Mrs. Tannenbaum * [[Carole Lazare]] as Edna * [[Mignon Elkins]] as Mr. Bondy * [[Cleo Paskal]] as Cleo ==Production== ''Lies My Father Told Me'' was entirely filmed in Montreal.

Cohen]], adapted from [[Stephen King]]'s [[Carrie (novel)|1974 epistolary novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Sissy Spacek]] as [[Carrie White]], a shy 16-year-old who is constantly mocked and bullied at school. The film also features [[Piper Laurie]], [[Amy Irving]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], [[William Katt]], [[P. J. Soles]], [[Betty Buckley]], and [[John Travolta]] in supporting roles. It is the first film in the [[Adaptations of Carrie|''Carrie'' franchise]]. The film was based on King's first published novel. De Palma was intrigued by the story and pushed for the studio to direct it while Spacek was encouraged by her husband to audition. It is the first of [[List of adaptations of works by Stephen King|more than 100]] film and television productions adapted from, or based on, the published works of King. Theatrically released on November 3, 1976, by [[United Artists]], ''Carrie'' became critically and commercially successful, grossing over $33.8 million against its $1.8 million budget. It received two nominations at the [[49th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Spacek) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Laurie). Critics and audience members alike widely cite it as the best adaptation of the novel amongst the numerous films and television shows based on the character, as well as one of the best films based on King's publications.

When Carrie experiences her [[First menstrual bleeding|first period]] in the school shower, she panics, having never been told about menstruation. Carrie's classmates throw tampons and sanitary pads at her while chanting ""Plug it up!"" until the gym teacher, Miss Collins, intervenes. Following conversations with Miss Collins and the principal, Carrie is dismissed from school for the day. After arriving home, Margaret tells Carrie that her menstruation was caused by sin, and she locks Carrie in an altar-like ""prayer closet"" to pray for forgiveness. At school, Collins reprimands Carrie's tormentors, punishing them with a week-long detention during gym class. She threatens that those who skip the punitive measure will be suspended for three days and barred from the upcoming prom. However, Carrie's longtime bully, Christine ""Chris"" Hargensen, walks out and gets excluded from the prom. Plotting vengeance against Carrie, Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan break into a farm and kill pigs to drain their blood into a bucket, which they place above the school's stage in the gymnasium. Norma, Chris' best friend and a prominent figure in the school's student council regime, plans to rig the Prom Queen election in Carrie's favor to get her on the stage. Meanwhile, [[Sue Snell]], a deeply remorseful classmate, asks her handsome and popular boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to invite Carrie to the prom. Carrie believes the proposition is a prank, but he insists that it is genuine and she reluctantly accepts after Miss Collins consoles her. At home, she begins to discover that she has [[telekinesis]] as she shakes off her shyness. Despite Margaret's protests, Carrie puts on a flattering dress and hairstyle for the prom. Margaret sees Carrie's telekinetic powers and denounces her as a witch before Carrie leaves with Tommy. During the prom, Chris and Billy hide under the stage while the other conspirators switch the ballots to ensure that Carrie wins the Prom Queen title. As Carrie stands onstage with Tommy, finally beginning to feel accepted by her peers, Sue realizes Chris and Billy's plan, and begins to intervene. Miss Collins spots Sue and, thinking that she is up to no good, throws her out of the prom. Chris and Billy pull the rope attached to the bucket of pig blood, dousing Carrie; they then sneak out of the school. The empty bucket hits the outraged Tommy in the head, and he collapses. The crowd is left shocked and speechless at the prank, but Carrie hallucinates that everyone, even Miss Collins, is mocking her and, in a sudden outburst, telekinetically seals the exits and controls a fire hose, which injures several party-goers attempting to escape and sprays the overhead lights. Miss Collins is crushed by a falling basketball backboard and Carrie's principal and teacher are electrocuted, setting the gym on fire. Carrie exits the gym and seals the doors behind her, trapping staff and classmates. As Carrie walks home, Chris and Billy attempt to run her over with Billy's car but Carrie causes their car to overturn and explode, killing them. After Carrie bathes herself at home, Margaret reveals that Carrie was conceived when her husband was drunk, an act that Margaret shamefully admits she enjoyed. She comforts Carrie, and then stabs her in the back with a kitchen knife and begins chasing her through the house. Carrie levitates several sharp implements and sends them flying toward Margaret, crucifying her; then, she destroys the house and perishes. Some time later, Sue, the only survivor of the prom, has a nightmare in which she goes to lay flowers on the charred remains of Carrie's home, upon which stands a ""For Sale"" sign vandalized in black paint with the words: ""Carrie White burns in Hell!"". Suddenly, Carrie's bloody arm reaches from beneath the rubble and grabs Sue's forearm. Sue wakes up screaming and writhing in terror as her mother tries to comfort her. ==Cast== {{cast list| <!-- The following are in the order the end credits.

Well, I had her husband [Fisk] bury her because I certainly didn't want to bury her"".<ref name=""United Artists""/> ===Music=== The score for ''Carrie'' was composed by [[Pino Donaggio]]. In addition, Donaggio scored two pop songs (""Born to Have It All"" and ""I Never Dreamed Someone Like You Could Love Someone Like Me"") with lyrics by Merrit Malloy for the early portion of the prom sequence. These songs were performed by Katie Irving (sister of Amy Irving and daughter of Priscilla Pointer). Donaggio would work again with De Palma on ''[[Home Movies (film)|Home Movies]]'', ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', ''[[Blow Out]]'', ''[[Body Double]]'', ''[[Raising Cain]]'', ''[[Passion (2012 film)|Passion]]'', and ''[[Domino (2019 film)|Domino]]''.

The film updated the events of the story to modern-day settings and technology while simultaneously attempting to be more faithful to the book's original structure, story, and specific events. However, the ending was drastically changed: Instead of killing her mother and then herself, the film has Carrie killing her mother, being revived via [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] by Sue Snell and being driven to Florida to hide. This new ending marked a complete divergence from the novel and was a signal that the film served as a pilot for a ''Carrie'' television series, which never materialized. In the new ending, the rescued Carrie vows to help others with similar gifts to her own. Although Bettis' portrayal of Carrie was highly praised, the film was cited by most critics as inferior to the original.<ref name=""million"">{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/news/sb/2002-11-04#tv5 |website=Internet Movie Database |title=TV Reviews: ""Carrie"" |date=November 4, 2002 |access-date=September 8, 2006 |archive-date=February 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228151951/http://imdb.com/news/sb/2002-11-04#tv5 |url-status=live}}</ref> ===2013 remake=== {{main|Carrie (2013 film)}} In 2011, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Screen Gems]] acquired the novel rights to adapt ''Carrie'' to film once more.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mgm-screen-gems-team-carrie-190369|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Borys|last=Kit|title=MGM, Screen Gems Team for 'Carrie' Remake|date=May 19, 2011|access-date=November 15, 2019|archive-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112054042/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mgm-screen-gems-team-carrie-190369|url-status=live}}</ref> Playwright [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] wrote the script as ""a more faithful adaptation"" of King's novel but shared a screenplay credit with the 1976 film's writer Lawrence D.

In the film, the song was [[lip sync]]hed by actress [[Didi Conn]]. Kvitka Cisyk also has a small part in the film as a wedding attendant. Cisyk's original soundtrack recording of ""You Light Up My Life"" was included on the soundtrack album which was rush-released by Arista Records after Boone included her version on her first solo album (also entitled ''[[You Light Up My Life (Debby Boone album)|You Light Up My Life]]'') and within less than three weeks, the soundtrack album was certified Gold by the RIAA, making it one of the fastest-breaking records in the label's history at that time. Boone's single reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for a then record-setting 10 consecutive weeks while Cisyk's version of the song was released simultaneously as a single to bolster sales of the soundtrack album.

A triple album containing many of the tracks heard in the film was released six weeks in advance of the theatrical release to build up interest in the film.<ref name=""harmetz"" /> Several songs heard in the film were not included on the soundtrack album, including [[Alec R. Costandinos]]' ""[[Romeo and Juliet]]"", [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s ""[[From Here to Eternity (Giorgio Moroder song)|From Here to Eternity]]"", [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]]' ""Down to Love Town"", [[D.C. LaRue]]'s ""You Can Always Tell a Lady (By the Company She Keeps)"", [[The Commodores]]' ""[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]"", [[The 5th Dimension]]'s ""You Are The Reason (I Feel Like Dancing)"", [[Meco]]'s ""Meco's Theme"" and the [[Village People]] tracks, ""In Hollywood (Everybody Is A Star)"" and ""[[I Am What I Am (Village People song)|I Am What I Am]]"". The biggest hit single on the album was Donna Summer's ""[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]"", which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] as well as a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song and also made it to #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US singles chart]]. The song was written by [[Paul Jabara]], who the following year composed Summer's duet with [[Barbra Streisand]], ""[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]"". Jabara performed two of the songs on the ''Thank God It's Friday'' soundtrack and appeared in the film as well. The soundtrack album was issued as a three-record set in 1978, of which the third disc was a single side 12&nbsp;inch single of the 15:45 minutes Donna Summer, ""[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]"" track. Upon its 1978 release, a promo set of separate 12"" singles of every track was released to select DJs only. An edited CD came out in 1995 on the budget label Rebound Records. A digitally remastered version of the full soundtrack on a 2 disc set was released on [[PolyGram]] Records on March 25, 1997. The company that holds the rights to the album is as of 1998 the [[Universal Music Group]]. The album is described by many as the world's only five-sided soundtrack album. [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]]'s ""Find My Way"" was issued as a 7"" single in 1975. [[Giorgio Moroder]] and Donna Summer's cover version of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[Jane Birkin]]'s 1969 hit single ""[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]"" was recorded a few years earlier, but had its debut on the soundtrack and was issued as an edited 7"" single in a few countries in 1978. ""[[Too Hot ta Trot]]"" was from [[The Commodores]]' 1977 album ''[[Commodores Live!]]'' – on certain editions of the ''Thank God It's Friday'' album replaced by a studio recording. The song topped Billboard's R & B chart the week of February 18, 1978. Other titles on the soundtrack, including ""[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]"", were recorded for the film. [[Diana Ross]]' ""[[Lovin', Livin' and Givin'|Lovin' Livin' and Givin']]"" was remixed after the release of the soundtrack and used as the opening track on her 1978 album ''[[Ross (1978 album)|Ross]]''. It was released as a single in certain territories and has since been remixed and re-edited a number of times for inclusion on various hits packages issued by [[Motown]]/Universal Music. The final part of [[Donna Summer]]'s ""[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]"" is later re-included as a separate track titled ""Reprise"" toward the end of the soundtrack album. An edited version of the whole track was the version issued on the 7"" single in most countries, and this track can be found on many of Summer's compilations, including 1994's ''[[Endless Summer: Greatest Hits|Endless Summer]]'' and 2003's ''[[The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer]]''. The 12"" single used the full-length 8:11 version. A live recording of the track was included on the album ''[[Live and More]]'', issued in late 1978 and the following year the studio version was remixed by [[Giorgio Moroder]] for what was to be Summer's final [[Casablanca Records]] album ''[[On The Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes 1 & 2]]''. The 1979 mix can be found on Summer's 1993 and 2005 compilations ''[[The Donna Summer Anthology]]'' and ''[[Gold (Donna Summer album)|Gold]]'' respectively. An extended remix of Summer's ""With Your Love"" was issued as a promo 12"" single in 1978; a slightly shorter version of this can be found on the cd [[Mercury Records]]/[[PolyGram]]'s 1987 release ''[[The Dance Collection: A Compilation of Twelve Inch Singles]]''. The 8 track cartridge and cassette both feature the full length version. ===Track listing=== '''Side one''' #[[Love & Kisses]]: ""[[Thank God It's Friday (Love & Kisses song)|Thank God It's Friday]]"" (Alec R.

It stars [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as a German stage actor (modeled on [[Gustaf Gründgens]]) who finds unexpected success and mixed blessings in the popularity of his performance in a [[Faust|Faustian]] play as the Nazis take power in pre-[[World War II|WWII]] [[Germany]]. As his associates and friends flee or are underground by the Nazi regime, the popularity of his character ends up superseding his own existence, until he finds that his best performance is keeping up appearances for his Nazi patrons. The film was a co-production of Hungarian, Austrian, and West German studios; starring a mix of German and Hungarian-speaking actors. It premiered in [[Budapest]] on 11 February 1981, and received widespread acclaim from critics, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film]], the first Hungarian picture to do so.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cunningham|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1UZBQAAQBAJ&dq=mephisto%20(april%20OR%20october)%201981%20-wikipedia%20-imdb%20-ebay&pg=PA157|title=The Cinema of István Szabó: Visions of Europe|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-231-17199-1|location=New York City|pages=157}}</ref> Brandauer's performance earned him multiple accolades, including [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] and [[German Film Award]] nominations, and launched his film career. ==Plot== The film adapts the story of [[Mephistopheles]] and [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]] by revealing the costs to the main character Hendrik Höfgen as he abandons his conscience and continues to perform, ingratiating himself with the [[Nazism|Nazi Party]] in order to retain his job and improve his social position. Höfgen (modeled on German actor [[Gustaf Gründgens]]) craves center stage. The first third of the film follows his career as a frustrated, passionate actor slogging it out in provincial theaters, occasionally dancing and singing and doing parts in films to gain notice. He even founds a Bolshevik theater with a friend to generate more work, in the avant-garde period of the early 1930s, before the Nazis came to power. Initially, Hendrik is more successful in his social and love life than as an actor. Both strands unite, however, when his new wife watches him play the ultimate role, Mephisto (the devil in the Faustus play), just before the Nazi party came to power in Germany. While his wife, leading actors, and friends go into exile, or protest against the new regime, Hendrik returns to Germany lured by the promise of forgiveness for his communist theatre escapade and a desire to act in his native language. When the Nazi party effectively offers to make him a star, he doesn't hesitate. Great roles and accolades quickly come his way, and Hendrik revels in his success. Hendrik reprises his greatest role as Mephisto and agrees to run the national theatre, working around the cultural restrictions and brutality of the Nazi government. He blithely overlooks the profound moral compromises of his situation, excusing himself by using the power of his close relationships with Nazi officials to help friends who would otherwise be targeted by the regime. The plot's bitter irony is that the protagonist's fondest dream is to become Germany's greatest actor, playing [[Hamlet]] and Mephisto, but in order to achieve this dream he sells his soul. In the process, he realizes too late that he is not playing the role of Mephisto but that of Faustus; it is the Nazi leader with a major role in the film (modeled on [[Hermann Göring]]) who is the real Mephisto. ==Cast== {{castlist| * [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as Hendrik Hoefgen * [[Krystyna Janda]] as Barbara Bruckner * [[Ildikó Bánsági]] as Nicoletta von Niebuhr * [[Rolf Hoppe]] as The General * [[György Cserhalmi]] as Hans Miklas *[[Karin Boyd]] as Juliette Martens * [[Péter Andorai]] as Otto Ulrichs * Christine Harbort as Lotte Lindenthal * [[Martin Hellberg]] as Professor Reinhardt * [[Tamás Major]] as Oskar Kroge * [[Ildikó Kishonti]] as Dora Martin * Mária Bisztrai as Motzné * Sándor Lukács as Rolf Bonetti * [[Ágnes Bánfalvy]] as Angelika Siebert * [[Judit Hernádi]] as Rachel Mohrenwitz * Vilmos Kun as stage manager *[[István Szabó]] as man in tuxedo }} ==Reception== The film was the highest-grossing Hungarian film in the United States and Canada with a gross of $3.9 million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=86|date=January 7, 1991|title=Pix from afar: National bests in the U.S.}}</ref> ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=""wikitable"" |- !

It stars [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as Shirley Muldowney and [[Beau Bridges]] as drag racing driver [[Connie Kalitta]]. The film garnered two award nominations: Bedelia for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama]], and [[William Ware Theiss|William Theiss]] for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. ==Plot== In 1956 [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]], waitress Shirley Roque marries auto mechanic Jack Muldowney over the mild objections of her singer father Tex, who wants her to be self-sufficient rather than having to rely on a husband. Jack buys a [[gas station]], Shirley becomes a housewife, and they have a son. For fun, Jack races his [[hot rod]] against others on deserted stretches of road late at night. One time, Shirley talks him into letting her drive. She wins and continues winning. A chance encounter with professional driver ""Big Daddy"" [[Don Garlits]] inspires her to look for sponsorship from one of the major car manufacturers, despite her husband's skepticism. As this is the 1950s, a pretty housewife is not taken seriously, especially since there are no women professional drivers, but when she returns home, Jack tells her that he can build her a [[dragster (car)|dragster]]. In 1966, she is ready. She still needs to get three signatures before she can get her [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) license, nearly impossible in the macho racing world. Finally, Garlits (seeing an opportunity to broaden the sport's popularity) signs, followed by [[funny car]] driver [[Connie Kalitta]], who has his own reasons; Connie talks a reluctant third driver into going along. In her first attempt to qualify for a race, she sets a track record. Later, during a dinner with their respective spouses, Connie gets her alone, [[Flirting|makes a pass]] at her, and she slaps him in the face. Shirley becomes successful, racing on weekends, but when Connie decides to move up to [[Top Fuel]] dragsters, she wants to buy his funny car and compete year round. This exhausts Jack's tolerance for Shirley's racing activity, as he feels neglected, and they [[Marital separation|separate]]. Connie and Shirley become involved romantically, despite his continual philandering. In a 1973 race, Shirley's funny car is destroyed and she is seriously burned. When Connie is suspended indefinitely by the NHRA for fighting on her behalf, she tells him that she is going to Top Fuel. He becomes her [[pit stop|crew chief]]. She wins her first NHRA national event in 1976, then the World Championship in 1977. Finally, tired of Connie's womanizing, she drops him from her team. Angry, he successfully pursues reinstatement by the NHRA. Shirley, with little sponsorship and an inexperienced crew, has two lean years, but she rebounds in 1980. She races against Connie in that year's NHRA championship final. She is victorious, and they reconcile. Jack, her ex-husband (who had watched the victory on TV), gives her a private cheer. ==Cast== *[[Bonnie Bedelia]] as [[Shirley Muldowney]] *[[Beau Bridges]] as [[Connie Kalitta]] *[[Leo Rossi]] as Jack Muldowney *[[Hoyt Axton]] as Tex Roque *[[Bill McKinney]] as ""Big Daddy"" [[Don Garlits]] *[[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as John Muldowney, Shirley and Jack's son *[[Tiffany Brissette]] as Little Shirley *[[Ellen Geer]] as Marianne Kalitta, Connie's wife The film also marked the film debut of character actor [[Leonard Termo]], who had a small role as Good Joe.<ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes|title=Character Actor Leonard Termo Dies at 77 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lenny-termo-mickey-rourke-seinfeld-384835 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref> ==Reception== ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Michael Sragow]] gave ''Heart Like a Wheel'' a mostly positive review, deeming it ""flawed but energetic"". He remarked that compared to other film biographies, the storyline and depiction of the core subject matter (drag racing) are lacking in drama and clarity, but in part because of that, are much more true to life. For this reason, he felt that drag racing enthusiasts would get more out of the film than those unfamiliar with the sport. He praised the acting as the movie's strongest point, particularly the performances by Bedelia and Bridges.<ref name=""RStone397"">{{cite journal |last=Sragow |first=Michael |title=Heart Like a Wheel: A Film Biography that Isn't a Drag|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 9, 1983 |issue=397|page=49|author-link=Michael Sragow}}</ref> ===Muldowney's reaction=== Muldowney would rather have had [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] play her; she called Bedelia ""a snot"", and stated, ""When she was promoting the movie on TV shows, she would tell interviewers she didn't even like racing.

It is said he wanted a ""[[Heigh-Ho]]"" of his own (referring to the popular song from Disney's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'').{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=94}} [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked on ''The Secret of NIMH'' with Bluth was initially supposed to work on the score, but had to drop out of the film due to a busy schedule. After he completed ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', [[James Horner]] composed the score for the film, which was recorded in England and performed by [[The London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]]. Two excerpts of period music also appear in the film: ''[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]'' by [[John Philip Sousa]] and ''Poor Wand'ring One'' from the 1880 comic opera ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. There is also a musical reference to the 1947 song ''[[Galway Bay (song)|Galway Bay]]'' popularized by [[Bing Crosby]]. Initially, Bluth and his team were disappointed with the first score recording, but once edited, they found the music worked quite well. The final score became one of the film's strongest points.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=95}} The initial songs were written by [[Tom Bahler]], who had worked as a music supervisor and composer. Bahler left the project, in which [[Cynthia Weil]] and [[Barry Mann]] were later brought on to compose new songs, collaborating with Horner. After the first round of songs were written, it was decided a special song would be written for [[Linda Ronstadt]] to sing over the end credits with [[James Ingram]].{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=95}} Titled ""[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]"", it later went on to win two [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television]]. It would become one of the most popular songs from an animated feature since the 1950s.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|pp=95, 101}} An official soundtrack containing 14 tracks from the film was first released on November 21, 1986, by [[MCA Records]], and was made available on [[compact cassette|audio cassette]], [[gramophone record|vinyl record]], and CD.<ref name=Amazon /> It was later released digitally by [[Geffen Records]] on February 5, 2013. ===Songs=== Original songs & scores performed in the film include: {{tracklist | all_writing = | all_lyrics = | all_music = | extra_column = Performer(s) |title1 = Main Title |extra1 = James Horner |title2 = The Cossack Cats |extra2 = Horner |title3 = There Are No Cats In America |extra3 = [[Nehemiah Persoff]], John Guarnieri & Warren Hays |title4 = The Storm |extra4 = Horner |title6 = Never Say Never |extra6 = [[Phillip Glasser]] & [[Christopher Plummer]] |title7 = The Market Place |extra7 = Horner |title8 = [[Somewhere Out There (An American Tail song)|Somewhere Out There]] |extra8 = [[Phillip Glasser]] & Betsy Cathcart |title9 = Somewhere Out There |extra9 = [[Linda Ronstadt]] & [[James Ingram]] |title10 = Releasing The Secret Weapon |extra10 = Horner |title11 = A Duo |extra11 = [[Phillip Glasser]] & [[Dom DeLuise]] |title12 = The Great Fire |extra12 = Horner |title13 = Reunited |extra13 = Horner |title14 = Flying Away & End Credits |extra14 = Horner }} == Reception == === Box office === The film has grossed up to $47&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada, and $84&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2487453185/weekend/|title=An American Tail|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 11, 1995|page=92|title=UIP's $25M-Plus Club}}</ref> At the time of its domestic release, it became the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated feature]] for an initial release<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=January 9, 1990|page=1|last=Eller|first=Claudia|title='Mermaid' Swims to Animation Record}}</ref> and the highest-grossing non-Disney produced animated feature.

The supporting cast include [[Larry Lamb]] and [[Sheila Hancock|Shelia Hancock]]. The [[Buster (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features two singles from Collins which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. ==Plot== [[Buster Edwards]] ([[Phil Collins]]) is a petty criminal from the [[East End of London|East End]] of 1963 [[London]]. His long-suffering wife June ([[Julie Walters]]) thinks of him as a [[lovable rogue]]. The film opens with Buster walking along his local high street. He breaks into a shop to steal a suit, into which he then changes to attend a funeral. Also attending the funeral is police inspector Mitchell ([[Martin Jarvis]]), who happens to be an old school friend of Buster and the others, and wants to 'keep in touch'. Buster brings Harry ([[Michael Attwell]]), who has been used on other 'jobs' and has recently served 18 months in prison for his part in previous robberies, to discuss the next 'job' with the ring-leader Bruce Reynolds ([[Larry Lamb]]). Harry wants 'in' and becomes part of the firm who are planning to rob a Royal Mail train allegedly carrying up to £1 million in cash. After a complex and successful heist, the gang return to their farmhouse hideout to stay out of sight and split the spoils. They find they have stolen over £3 million − much more than they have anticipated or reported by the media. Members of the gang are shown drinking from beer bottles and glasses without wearing gloves, thereby leaving fingerprints which would be evidence of their involvement in the robbery. While lying low at the farmhouse, they hear on the radio that the police (who are being led by Mitchell) are searching farmhouses and outhouses within a {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of the robbery site. The gang become nervous and some members want to immediately return to London for fear of discovery; others think they should keep to the original plan and stay put. The gang decide to return to London, where they meet their 'contact', a solicitor's clerk who, as in the original plan, arranges for the farmhouse to be 'cleared and cleaned', thereby destroying any physical evidence linking the gang to the robbery. The contact states he will bring the plans forward from a few weeks to the next two to three days. Bruce, Buster and Harry are not happy with any delay at all because they fear imminent discovery, so they set off back to the farmhouse in their own car, to do the job themselves. During the journey, they hear on the car radio that the farmhouse hideout has been discovered, so they abandon their plans and return to London, hoping they will have time to escape with their families. Buster returns home, and is devastated to find that June has had a [[miscarriage]] while he was committing the robbery. She cannot believe it when she learns of his involvement in what has been quickly dubbed ""[[Great Train Robbery (1963)|The Great Train Robbery]]"". Politicians, incensed that the gang are being treated as [[antihero]]s by the newspapers, demand that they be punished with extraordinarily long prison sentences, and that no [[plea bargain]]s (""deals"") will be offered to any of the accused. As more of the gang are rounded up by the police, and several months after the robbery, Buster and June remain in hiding with their young daughter Nicky ([[Ellie Beaven]]) until they are turned in to the police by a suspicious neighbour. Mitchell and an army of officers arrive too late and discover that they have already fled. Meanwhile, Harry is also arrested by Mitchell, who defies his superiors to offer Harry a deal in return for disclosing Buster and Bruce's whereabouts, but he refuses. Buster flees to [[Acapulco]], where he is met by Bruce and his girlfriend Franny ([[Stephanie Lawrence]]), who are also on the run and living it up in the sun on the profits of the crime. June and Nicky arrive later, despite the disapproval of her mother ([[Sheila Hancock]]), and although Nicky seems to love her new life in the sun, June is immediately unimpressed with their new way of life and resolves to return to [[England]], despite knowing that if Buster is to return with them he will be imprisoned. Buster remains in Acapulco for some time after June leaves, until realizing (while celebrating England's 1966 World Cup triumph) that having money and the sun means nothing if he doesn't have his family. He returns to England, in the full knowledge he will have to face justice, but in the hope that a deal with Mitchell to reduce his jail sentence will be available, but he is soon arrested and is sentenced to 15 years in prison. Skipping forward to a later date after he has been released, Buster is now seemingly content and running a flower stall near London's [[Waterloo Bridge]], but he breaks the [[fourth wall]] and explains to the audience he still has a ""dream"", as he and June walk away as the end credits roll. ==Cast== {{Cast listing| * [[Phil Collins]] as [[Buster Edwards]] * [[Julie Walters]] as June Edwards * [[Larry Lamb]] as [[Bruce Reynolds]] * [[Stephanie Lawrence]] as Franny Reynolds * [[Ellie Beaven]] as Nicky Edwards * [[Ralph Brown]] as [[Ronald Biggs]] * [[Christopher Ellison]] as George * [[Sheila Hancock]] as Mrs. Rothery * [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] as Inspector Jack Mitchell * [[Anthony Quayle]] as Sir James McDowell * [[Michael Attwell]] as Harry * [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Poyser * [[Clive Wood]] as Sergeant Chalmers * [[Harold Innocent]] as Justice Parry * [[Rupert Vansittart]] as Fairclough * [[John Benfield]] as Jimmy * [[John Barrard]] as Walter * Carole Collins as Linda * Amy Shindler as Susan * David Shindler as David * [[Vincenzo Nicoli]] as gang member * [[Steve McFadden]] as gang member (uncredited) }} ==Production== Pre-production began in [[1987]], with Collins first being associated with the project during [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' [[Invisible Touch Tour|tour]] for the 1986 album ''[[Invisible Touch]]''.

It is the story of Éliane Devries, a French plantation owner, and of her adopted [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] daughter, Camille, set against the backdrop of the rising [[Vietnam]]ese nationalist movement. The screenplay was written by novelist [[Érik Orsenna]], screenwriters [[Louis Gardel]] and Catherine Cohen, and director [[Régis Wargnier]]. The film stars [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Vincent Pérez]], [[Linh Dan Pham]], [[Jean Yanne]] and [[Dominique Blanc]]. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[65th Academy Awards]], and Deneuve was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].<ref name=""Oscars1993""/> ==Plot== The story is narrated by Éliane Devries, a woman born to French parents in colonial [[French Indochina|Indochina]], and is told through flashbacks. In 1930, Éliane runs her and her widowed father's large [[rubber]] [[plantation]] with many indentured laborers, whom she casually refers to as her [[coolies]], and divides her days between her homes at the plantation and outside [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]]. She is also the adoptive mother of Camille, whose birth parents were friends of Éliane's and members of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. Guy Asselin, the head of the French security services in Indochina, courts Éliane, but she rejects him and raises Camille alone giving her the education of a privileged European through her teens. Éliane meets a young [[French Navy]] lieutenant, Jean-Baptiste Le Guen, when they bid on the same painting at an [[auction]]. She is flustered when he challenges her publicly and surprised when he turns up at her plantation days later, searching for a boy whose [[sampan]] he set ablaze on suspicion of [[opium]] smuggling. Éliane and Jean-Baptiste begin a torrid affair. Camille meets Jean-Baptiste by chance one day when he rescues her from a terrorist attack. Believing him to have saved her life, Camille falls in love with Jean-Baptiste at first sight, while Jean-Baptiste has no inkling of Camille's relation to Éliane. When Éliane learns of Camille's love for Jean-Baptiste, she uses her connections with high-ranking Navy officials to get Jean-Baptiste transferred to [[Haiphong]]. Jean-Baptiste angrily confronts Éliane about his transfer during a Christmas party at her home, resulting in a heated argument where he slaps her in front of his fellow officers. For his transgression, Jean-Baptiste is sent to the notorious [[Hạ Long Bay|Dragon Islet]] (Hòn Rồng), a remote French military base in northern Indochina. Éliane allows Camille to become engaged to Thanh, a pro-[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] Vietnamese boy expelled as a student from France because of his support for the 1930 [[Yên Bái mutiny]]. A sympathetic Thanh allows Camille to search for Jean-Baptiste up north. Camille travels on foot and eventually makes it to Dragon Islet, where she and a Vietnamese family she travels with are imprisoned alongside other laborers. When Camille comes across the sight of her traveling companions brutally tortured and murdered by French officers, she attacks a French officer and shoots him in the struggle. Jean-Baptiste defies his superiors to protect Camille in the ensuing firefight, and the two set sail and escape Dragon Islet as outlaws. After spending several days adrift in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], Camille and Jean-Baptiste reach land and are taken in by a Communist theater troupe, who offers the couple refuge in a secluded valley. After several months, Camille has become pregnant with Jean-Baptiste's child, but they are told they must vacate the valley out of safety. Thanh, now a high-ranking Communist operative, arranges for the theater troupe to smuggle the lovers into China. Guy attempts to use operatives to quell the growing insurrections by laborers and to locate Camille and Jean-Baptiste, without success. Camille and Jean-Baptiste's story becomes a celebrated legend in [[tuồng]] performances by Vietnamese actors, earning Camille the popular nickname ""the Red Princess"". When the couple nears the Chinese border, Jean-Baptiste takes his and Camille's newborn son to [[baptize]] him in a river while she's asleep. After christening the baby Étienne, he is ambushed and apprehended by several French soldiers. A distraught Camille evades capture and escapes with the theater troupe, while French authorities remand Jean-Baptiste to a Saigon jail and hand Étienne over to Éliane. After some days in prison, Jean-Baptiste agrees to talk if he can first see his son. The Navy, which has authority over the case and refuses to subject Jean-Baptiste to interrogation by the police, plans to court-martial Jean-Baptiste in [[Brest, France]] to avoid the public outcry that would likely arise from a trial in Indochina. Jean-Baptiste is allowed a 24-hour visitation with Étienne before being taken to France. He goes to see Éliane, who lets him stay with Étienne at her Saigon residence for the night. The next day, Éliane finds Jean-Baptiste dead in his bed with a gunshot to his temple, a gun in hand, and an unharmed Étienne. Outraged, Éliane tells Guy she suspects the police murdered him, but Guy's girlfriend tells Éliane that the Communists may have killed Jean-Baptiste to silence him. With no evidence sought for either suspicion, Jean-Baptiste's death is ruled a suicide. Camille is captured and sent to [[Côn Đảo Prison|Poulo-Condor]] – a high security prison where visitors are not permitted and not even Éliane or Guy can help free her. After five years, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] comes to power and releases all political prisoners including Camille. Éliane reunites with Camille, but she declines to return to her mother and son, choosing instead to join the Communists and [[First Indochina War|fight for Vietnam's independence]]. Camille reasons she does not wish for her son to know the horrors she has witnessed, and tells her mother that French colonialism is drawing to an end. Taking Étienne with her, Éliane sells her plantation and leaves Indochina. In 1954, Éliane finishes telling her story to a grown Étienne. They have both come to [[Switzerland]], where Camille is a [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]] delegate to the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Conference]]. Étienne goes to the negotiators' hotel intending to find his birth mother, but it is so crowded with people that he is not sure how Camille can find or recognize him. He tells Éliane he sees her as his mother. As the film concludes, an epilogue notes the next day, French Indochina becomes independent from France and [[Partition of Vietnam|Vietnam is partitioned]] into [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]]. ==Cast== *[[Catherine Deneuve]] as Éliane Devries *[[Vincent Pérez]] as Jean-Baptiste *[[Linh Dan Pham]] as Camille *[[Jean Yanne]] as Guy *[[Dominique Blanc]] as Yvette *Henri Marteau as Émile *Thi Hoe Tranh Huu Trieu as Mme.

He continued ""'''Indochine''<nowiki/>' is an ambitious, gorgeous missed opportunity – too slow, too long, too composed.

Upon the arrival of Manolo's four daughters in a train, Fernando is enchanted by them all. As he meets each of the first three one by one, he falls in love and has sex with each of them, determining to marry. With each one, however, a complication arises: Clara, a widow who only recently lost her husband and who seeks solace with Fernando; Violeta, a [[lesbian]] who is attracted to Fernando only when he is dressed as a woman for a costume ball and Rocío, a social climber who is about to marry to Juanito into the village's richest family (with [[Carlism|Carlist leanings]]) for the security it would provide and who only momentarily succumbs to Fernando's charms. Heartbroken each time, the father of the girls encourages Fernando to have patience. Each of the daughters is beautiful and represents a different aspect of feminine sexuality. The youngest of the family, Luz, represents naïveté. While Fernando is pursuing her sisters, Luz gets progressively angry and jealous. Eventually Fernando realizes, however, that Luz is the best one of the four to marry. ==Cast== {{Cast listing| * [[Jorge Sanz]] as Fernando{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Fernando Fernán-Gómez]] as Manolo{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Maribel Verdú]] as Rocío{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Ariadna Gil]] as Violeta{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Penélope Cruz]] as Luz{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Miriam Díaz Aroca]] as Clara{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Gabino Diego]] as Juanito{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Agustín González (actor)|Agustín González]] as Don Luis{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Chus Lampreave]] as Doña Asun{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Mary Carmen Ramírez]] as Amalia{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Michel Galabru]] as Danglard{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Jesús Bonilla]] as Guardia Civil{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * {{ill|Juan José Otegui|es}} as El cabo{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[María Galiana]] as La Polonia{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * {{ill|Joan Potau|es}} as El alguacil{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * [[Manuel Huete|Manolo Huete]] as Un lugareño{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * José Antonio Sacristán as Rorro{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * Marciano de la Fuente as El alcalde{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} * {{ill|Félix Cubero|es}} as Palomo{{sfn|Alegre|2017|p=71}} }} == Production == A Spanish-Portuguese-French co-production, ''Belle Époque'' was produced by Fernando Trueba PC, Lola Films, Animatógrafo and French Production with collaboration of Sogepaq and [[Eurimages]].{{Sfn|Alegre|2017|p=70}} The film was shot in the summer of 1992 in several villages of [[Portugal]].{{Sfn|Alegre|2017|p=35}} == Release == The film was theatrically released in Spain on 4 December 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elcorreo.com/butaca/anos-estreno-belle-20171215114223-ntrc.html|website=[[El Correo]]|author=Boquerini|title=Y de repente, Trueba se volvió impresionista|date=14 December 2017}}</ref> ==Critical reception== ''Belle Époque'' received positive reviews getting a 93% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

The [[protagonist]] is depicted as a [[tragic hero]] with an intense dislike of the pro-war [[jingoism]] which surrounds him. The film's title is Ellis Evans' [[bardic name]] ({{IPA-cy|heːð wɨ̞n|pron}}, ""blessed peace""), under which he was posthumously awarded the [[Chairing of the Bard|Chair]] at the 1917 [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].<ref name=""MEW 1""/><ref name=""Archifau"">{{cite web|title=Hedd Wyn Manuscripts |url=http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=39&coll_id=10481&expand=|date=16 November 2004 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |publisher=[[Archives Network Wales|Archives Wales]] |work=[[Archives Network Wales|Archives Wales]] website}}</ref> ''Hedd Wyn'' won the [[Royal Television Society]]'s Award for Best Single Drama and [[BAFTA Cymru]] Awards in several categories; and was the first [[Welsh language]] film nominated for an [[Academy Award]].<ref name=""Wales Arts"">{{cite web|title=Welsh film history: 1990–99 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/film/pages/history-1990-1999.shtml |accessdate=11 December 2010 |publisher=[[BBC]]|date=5 March 2010|work=[[BBC Cymru Wales]] website}}</ref><ref name=""Oscars1994"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1994 |title=The 66th Academy Awards (1994) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=25 September 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> ==Plot== As the camera pans over the intricate carving on the infamous ""Black Chair"", the voice of the [[Archdruid]] Dyfed is heard vainly summoning the poet who signs his work with the ''nom de plume'' ""[[Fleur-de-lys|Fleur-de-lis]]"" to stand and be [[Chairing of the Bard|chaired]]. The film then [[Flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to 1913. As a farmer's son in the village of [[Trawsfynydd]], Ellis Humphrey Evans composes poetry for local [[eisteddfod]]au under the bardic name ''Hedd Wyn'' (""Blessed Peace""). A friend and student minister, William Morris ([[Arwel Gruffydd]]), advises Ellis that his verse possesses a passion which better educated poets lack. Therefore, with more work and less womanizing, Ellis could win the National Eisteddfod. Ellis smiles and quips, ""Where do you think all that passion comes from?"" Meanwhile, international tensions rise and the [[British Army]] installs an artillery range on a local hillside, much to Ellis' annoyance. In August 1914, Britain declares war on [[German Empire|Germany]]. Soon afterwards, at a gathering in the village street, an [[Church in Wales|Anglican]] minister gives a rousing sermon which demands immediate enlistment in the armed forces. Disgusted, William Morris calls the Anglican minister ""a disgrace to his calling"", and tells those nearby not to be deceived. In spite of this, several young men from Trawsfynydd join the British Army, including Ellis' friend Griff Jones ([[Gruffudd Aled]]). Despite mounting pressure, Ellis refuses to enlist and says that he does not think he can kill anyone. As a result, Ellis' fiancée, Lizzie Roberts ([[Sue Roderick]]), accuses him of being ""afraid of becoming a man"". At a fair, Ellis attempts to mend his relationship with Lizzie, only to find that she has formed a romantic relationship with an English soldier, informing Ellis that ""It's nothing personal... I just don't like your clothes."" Later, in the village pub, Ellis and Moi Davies ([[Emlyn Gomer]]) are giving Griff, who is now in uniform, a send-off. As fellow villagers sing the recruiting song ""[[Your King and Country Want You]]"" in their honour, Lizzie appears in the pub's doorway. Ellis spots her and begins to loudly sing ""[[Myfanwy]]"", a song with implications of female betrayal. Sensing Lizzie's distress, her new beau punches Ellis in the face, yelling ""You're upsetting the lady! Welsh bastard!"" On a train, Ellis encounters Jini Owen ([[Judith Humphreys]]), a young woman who admires his poetry. Noticing her interest in him, Ellis asks for Jini's address and sends her a letter. Soon the two are deeply in love. Simultaneously, Ellis develops a close friendship with Mary Catherine Hughes ([[Nia Dryhurst]]), the young woman who is his sister's teacher. He explains to her that, whenever a poem is lacking, he will cast it into the river, and that it will always return to him stronger. On a railway journey with Jini, Ellis encounters two hideously disfigured war veterans. Despite his sympathy for their plight, the soldiers accuse Ellis of cowardice for remaining a civilian. As he and Jini depart, one of the soldiers threatens to mail him a white feather. Ellis quips, ""You don't have any wings, let alone feathers."" Ultimately, Lizzie returns to the village with [[tuberculosis]]. After a church service, she informs Ellis that he was right about the war, which is a curse. Later, as Lizzie lies dying, Ellis visits her sickbed and promises to bring her to the National Eisteddfod. Soon afterwards, an official of the draft board arrives at the family farm and takes down the names of Ellis and his brother Bob (Ceri Cunnington), despite the resistance of Ellis' mother ([[Llio Silyn]]). As a result, the Crown informs the Evans family that one of their sons must enlist in the British Army. Although 17-year-old Bob longs to enlist instead, Ellis refuses to permit this. Horrified of losing him, Jini pleads with Ellis to let Bob enlist in his place. Enraged, Ellis says that, if Bob were injured or killed, he could never live with himself. With Jini seeing him off, Ellis departs by train to join the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] in [[Liverpool]].<ref name=""Archifau""/> Despite the insults showered on them by their English-speaking [[drill sergeant]], Ellis and his fellow Fusiliers continue their training in good spirits and are sent to France. Facing what may be his last chance to win the Eisteddfod, Ellis pleads with his platoon commander to send his [[awdl]] ''[[Hedd Wyn#Yr Awr|Yr Arwr]]'' (The Hero) via the Army Postal Service. The young officer, who is unable to read Welsh, at first refuses, suspecting the poem to be a coded message to the [[Imperial German Army|Germans]]. Eventually he relents, mails Ellis' submission, and praises him as ""The [[Armageddon]] Poet"". On 31 July 1917, the Fusiliers go [[Going over the top|over the top]] and into the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. Crawling through swampy shell holes filled with corpses, Ellis witnesses his fellow soldiers being shot and blown to pieces around him. At last, he is wounded by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and crumples to the ground. After hours of lying in [[no man's land]], Ellis is evacuated to an aid post, where he succumbs to his injuries. His parents are devastated when they receive a [[telegram]] informing them of Ellis' death. Jini weeps inconsolably as she reads Ellis' last letter, in which her beloved proposed marriage in a poem. Mary Catherine, in a last tribute to her friend, casts the manuscript of Ellis' poem ''Rhyfel'' (War) into the river. The Evans family receives another telegram which announces that Ellis' submission has won the National Eisteddfod. To the sound of [[R. Williams Parry]]'s ''[[Englynion coffa Hedd Wyn]]'' ([[Englyn]]ion in memory of Hedd Wyn), the chair which Ellis has dreamed of all his life is delivered to his parents' farmhouse, robed in black. ==Commentary== ''Hedd Wyn'' has been cited by Kate Woodward of [[Aberystwyth University]] as one of ""a number of films produced for S4C which ... scrutinized the trinity of dynamic tensions that existed between Wales, England and 'Britain'"".<ref name=""Woodward"">{{cite journal|last=Woodward |first=Kate |title=Traditions and transformations: film in Wales during the 1990s |url=http://www.learningace.com/doc/984600/d8eb6b9d94d592b0e3de94accf694058/k-woodward |accessdate=18 November 2014 |journal=North American Journal of Welsh Studies |volume=6 |edition=1 (winter 2006)|page=50 |year=2006 }}</ref> It is described as ""expressing the feelings of Welsh men who are fighting the British cause in wartime, despite their being at odds with aspects of the conflict and the priorities of a Westminster government....In the film, the war-mongering attitude is synonymous with England and Englishness, and the Welsh and English languages are persistently juxtaposed....[T]he Welsh language is a site of struggle, but by exploring its difference with the English language, it is also a means of defining and strengthening one’s identity"".<ref name=""Woodward""/> ==Awards== ''Hedd Wyn'' was the first Welsh film [[List of British submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|to be nominated]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], in 1993, at the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences [[Academy Awards]].

Bob works as a dentist and is seemingly going through a mid-life crisis on his 40th birthday. The short film shows Bob staring at a young woman in the office while his wife is at home working on the surprise party. She has a closet full of decorations to make the celebration fun for everyone. Back in the office, one of Bob's patients goes on to tell him that he had read that dentists have the highest suicide rate of all professions and continues to ask about his hours and salary while Bob works on the patient's teeth. The film continues at Bob and Margaret's home where all of their friends have arrived for the party. As they await Bob's presence, Margaret watches the time and quickly checks the window to notice he is driving down the road and tells the guests to hide until she gives a signal for them to come out. When Bob arrives, he walks directly to the kitchen, disregarding Margaret, and then asks her if she is bothered that they never had children and questions whether he should leave his job as a dentist. The guests continue to hide while Bob goes upstairs to change. As he is changing he comes down the stairs not wearing pants and Margaret frantically tells him to put pants on. He takes this to offence and says that she used to love when he did that, furthering his mid-life crisis even more. Bob continues speaking about how all of their friends, who are hiding behind couches and listening, are not really their friends and that they do not even like them. He goes on to say that Margaret should find another husband and becomes jealous. Bob yells up to Margaret, who is in the bedroom and upset over the disaster of a surprise party, and says that they should have children. He goes on to ask if she finds him attractive while she brings down pants and trousers for him. Bob goes outside to wait in the car because he still believes they are going out for dinner. Margaret follows him, knowing the party she had planned is now destroyed, and leaves all their friends she had invited behind.<ref>National Film Board of Canada.</ref> ==Cast== {{Cast listing| * [[Alison Snowden]] as Margaret Fish * [[Andy Hamilton]] as Dr. Bob Fish * [[Harry Enfield]] * [[Andrew MacLachlan]] * Tessa Wojtczak * [[Sally Grace]] }} ==Production== The short film took two years to complete.

At the city of Metropolis' airport, an overzealous sniffer dog falsely signals that Babe and Esme are carrying drugs, causing them to miss their flight and forcing a few days wait for the next flight home. At first unable to find a hotel that allows animals, Esme and Babe find accommodation at a hotel run by Miss Floom, who likes animals. There Babe is separated from Esme and meets a trio of chimpanzees—Bob, his wife Zootie and his little brother Easy—and Thelonius, a civilized Bornean orangutan who is a butler for the landlady's elderly uncle, Fugly. Babe is made part of their clown act, which he is reluctant to appear in until the apes insinuate that he will be paid. Meanwhile, Esme, believing Babe has escaped, goes looking for him but is arrested after an incident involving [[police officers]] and other bystanders while a gang of motorcycles attempted to mug her. The next morning, Fugly is taken to the hospital in a food coma, accompanied by his niece. Left to fend for themselves, the hotel's animal occupants soon become hungry and the chimps decide to steal food from a store, using Babe to distract a pair of guard dogs. Babe rescues one of the dogs when he falls into a canal, who pledges to act as bodyguard to Babe. Having flown all the way to Metropolis, Ferdinand the Duck finds Babe at the hotel, where Zootie gives birth to twins. The celebration is interrupted when several unfriendly [[animal control officer]]s are summoned there by the Flooms' neighbour, Hortense, who dislikes animals. Most of the animals are removed except for Babe, Ferdinand, a capuchin monkey called Tug and a disabled Jack Russell terrier named Flealick. They infiltrate the animal control facility and rescue their wrongfully imprisoned friends. Released from custody, Esme returns to the hotel to find it in disarray and Miss Floom mourning her uncle and the animals capture. After confronting Hortense since she is the one responsible, they track down the animals to a charity dinner and retrieve them all. Floom sells the hotel and gives the proceeds to Esme to save the farm, where she and all the animals go to stay. Esme resumes her duties and Arthur recovers, and after finally fixing the farm's water pump, proudly smiles at Babe and says, ""That'll do, Pig. That'll do."" ==Cast== * [[Magda Szubanski]] as Esme Cordelia Hoggett, Arthur's wife. * [[Mickey Rooney]] as Fugly Floom, Miss Floom's late uncle. * [[Mary Stein]] as Miss Floom, the hotel's landlady and Fugly's niece. * [[James Cromwell]] as Arthur Hoggett, Esme's husband. * Julie Godfrey as Hortense, the Flooms' neighbor. * Janet Foye and Pamela Hawkins as Miss Hoggett's friends. * [[Paul Livingston]] as a chef at the charity event * Kim Story as the judge<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indb.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 June 2022 |archive-date=30 December 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230131807/http://www.indb.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> * John Upton as a boy at the hospital ===Voices=== * [[E.

Slade's persona ""Maxwell Demon"" was named after [[Brian Eno]]'s first band, which itself was influenced by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s thought experiment character, ""[[Maxwell's demon]]"". * Wild's backing band, The Rats, shares its name with one of [[Mick Ronson]]'s earliest groups.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Velvet Goldmine – The Movie |url=http://www.5years.com/velvetfilm2.htm |access-date= |website=www.5years.com}}</ref> It also alludes to Iggy Pop's band, [[The Stooges]] in that both words share a similar meaning (""rat"" and ""stooge"" both being terms for someone who is an informer). * The scene where couples are shown walking into the Sombrero Club on New Year's Eve 1969 is similar to a shot of people entering a party from Welles' film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} * Maxwell Demon's guitarist shares his name, Trevor, with Bowie's [[The Spiders from Mars]] bassist [[Trevor Bolder]], and his last name is Finn, as [[T.

This is likely an allusion to Bowie basing some songs on the album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' on the dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. *The scene near the middle of the film that portrays Slade and Wild about to make love as [[Barbie]] Dolls, pays homage to Haynes' earlier work in ''[[Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story]]'', which was acted out primarily with the dolls. ==References== {{Reflist}} ===Bibliography=== * {{cite journal|last=Padva |first=Gilad |title=Claiming Lost Gay Youth, Embracing Femininostalgia: Todd Haynes's ''Dottie Gets Spanked'' and ''Velvet Goldmine''. |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137266347_5 |journal=Queer Nostalgia in Cinema and Pop Culture |pages=72–97 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2014 |doi=10.1057/9781137266347_5 |isbn=978-1-137-26633-0}} ==External links== {{wikiquote}} * {{IMDb title|0120879}} * {{Mojo title|velvetgoldmine}} * {{Rotten Tomatoes|velvet_goldmine}} * [{{AllMusic|class=album|r380467|pure_url=yes}} Review of ''Velvet Goldmine'' Original Soundtrack] ({{Rating|4|5}}) from [[AllMusic]] {{Todd Haynes}} {{Authority control}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Velvet Goldmine}} [[Category:1998 films]] [[Category:1990s French-language films]] [[Category:1990s musical drama films]] [[Category:1998 LGBT-related films]] [[Category:British musical drama films]] [[Category:British independent films]] [[Category:British LGBT-related films]] [[Category:British nonlinear narrative films]] [[Category:American musical drama films]] [[Category:American independent films]] [[Category:American LGBT-related films]] [[Category:American nonlinear narrative films]] [[Category:American rock music films]] [[Category:British rock music films]] [[Category:Bisexuality-related films]] [[Category:Films about music and musicians]] [[Category:Films about singers]] [[Category:Films scored by Carter Burwell]] [[Category:Films directed by Todd Haynes]] [[Category:Films produced by Christine Vachon]] [[Category:Films set in the 1970s]] [[Category:Films set in 1974]] [[Category:Films set in 1984]] [[Category:Films set in Berlin]] [[Category:Films set in London]] [[Category:Films set in New York City]] [[Category:Incest in film]] [[Category:Punk films]] [[Category:Killer Films films]] [[Category:Film4 Productions films]] [[Category:Newmarket Capital Group films]] [[Category:1998 independent films]] [[Category:Cultural depictions of David Bowie]] [[Category:Films à clef]] [[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]] [[Category:Glam rock]] [[Category:Male bisexuality in film]] [[Category:1998 drama films]] [[Category:Films shot in Greater Manchester]] [[Category:1990s English-language films]] [[Category:1990s American films]] [[Category:1990s British films]]","distributor = {{Plainlist| * [[Film4 Productions|FilmFour Distribution]]<br />(United Kingdom) * [[Miramax|Miramax Films]]<br />(United States) }} | "

While baking a cake one night, she is continually bothered by a large [[moth]] that keeps flying around her kitchen. No matter what she does, she cannot get rid of the intruder; she is especially annoyed when it runs into a photograph, taken many years ago, of herself and her late husband on their wedding day. Eventually, she knocks it into the cake batter, which she quickly and angrily pours into a pan and shoves into the oven. She then sets the kitchen timer and falls asleep, only to be awakened by loud rumblings and a blue-white light coming from the oven, whose door soon falls open. Crawling inside, she finds herself face-to-face with the moth and begins to float through an otherworldly space toward the source of the light, with a pair of giant moth wings sprouting from her back to propel her as the insect leads her along. She is soon revealed to be among dozens of moths being drawn to the light. The film ends with a close-up of the wedding photo, which comes to life as the younger Bunny nestles her head contentedly on her husband's shoulder; the shadows and reflections of two of the moths play across the image as well.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/1999Bunny 1999 Bunny: Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming: Internet Archive]</ref> During his introduction to the film on the ''Ice Age'' DVD, Wedge offers his take of these events: Bunny dies in her sleep, and the oven serves as a gateway to the afterlife. Her spirit is instinctively drawn into it, as a moth going toward a bright light, and is finally reunited with her husband.<ref>[https://animatedviews.com/2002/ice-age-2-disc-special-edition/ Ice Age: Disc Special Edition - Animated Views]</ref> ==Accolades== *1999: [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] (won) <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTQODmIlTAw Short Film Winners: 1999 Oscars]</ref> ==References== {{Reflist}} ==External links== * {{Official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20210209220748/http://blueskystudios.com/films/bunny/}} * {{bcdb title|id=29252|title=Bunny}} * {{IMDb title|id=0179011|title=Bunny}} * {{tcmdb title|521922|Bunny}} {{Navboxes | title = Awards for ''Bunny'' | list1 = {{AcademyAwardBestAnimatedShortFilm 1981–2000}} {{Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject}} }} {{Chris Wedge}} {{Blue Sky Studios}} [[Category:1998 films]] [[Category:1998 computer-animated films]] [[Category:1998 short films]] [[Category:1990s American animated films]] [[Category:1990s animated short films]] [[Category:Animated films about rabbits and hares]] [[Category:Animated films about insects]] [[Category:Animated films without speech]] [[Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners]] [[Category:Best Animated Short Subject Annie Award winners]] [[Category:Blue Sky Studios short films]] [[Category:20th Century Fox short films]] [[Category:Computer-animated short films]] [[Category:Films directed by Chris Wedge]] [[Category:Films about the afterlife]] [[Category:Films about death]]",NA

They explore and reject several options including watching television (the only thing on is 'some weird animation thing'), listening to the radio (but 'it's all the same rubbish these days' - in this case [[La Cucaracha]]) and playing chess (the white pieces have been eaten due to a bet). This is briefly interrupted when the doorbell rings and one character answers it to find a pesky dog (who is, in fact, a double-glazing salesman) before the other persuades him to enter into a game of shadow puppets. The first character is frustrated by his acquaintance's appalling representation of a [[cow]] and later his failure to recognize a rather fantastic [[rabbit]] (His misled guesses include a 'fireman chasing an igloo' and an 'Otter with two sausage strapped to his head'). After an amusing outburst from the poor fellow, his annoying partner accuses him of being 'shirty'. This leads him to explode, furiously crying ""I'm stuck indoors playing 'Guess the misshapen beast' with someone who clearly wouldn't recognise a rabbit if it came to his house for tea, said '[[Bugs Bunny|What's up Doc?]]' and started burrowing into his head! There are blind people with no fingers who are better at shadow puppets than you! No wonder I'm a tad miffed!"" An awkward silence follows this, until the doorbell rings and the first character goes to answer it and finds the second character's 'cow' shadow puppet, which moos. Despite being disappointed with being wrong about a cow's appearance, he simply responds to this with a cheery ""Not today, thank you."" and closes the door in front of the camera, thus ending the animation.<ref>[http://bestanimatedshort.blogspot.com/2012/04/best-animated-short-1999.html Best Animated Short: Best Animated Short - 1999]</ref> ==Cast== * [[Jack Docherty]] * [[Moray Hunter]]<ref>[https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/38998-Humdrum BCDB]</ref> ==Film technique== The film employs a distinctive [[stop motion]] [[cutout animation]] technique to animate the shadow puppets,<ref>[https://www.awn.com/animationworld/fresh-festivals-october-1999s-film-reviews Fresh From the Festivals: October 1999's Film Reviews-AWN]</ref> making them move in ways that traditional shadow puppets cannot but retaining the impression of being projected onto everyday backgrounds. ==Credits== *Lighting Camera: Andy MacCormack, Jeremy Hogg, Toby Howell *Design: Peter Peake *Music: [[Andy Price]] *Editor: Nick Upton *Script Doctor: [[Richard Goleszowski]] *Dubbing Editors: James Mather, Ben Jones *Dialogue Editor: Tamsin Parry *Sparks: John Bradley, John Truckle *Technical Boffs: Janet Legg, Alan Yates *Titles: Marc Day *Cutting Room Assistant: Maggie O'Connor *Production Assistants: Lisa Pavitt, Margaret House-Hayes *Heap Big Thanks to: The Puppet Factory, Big Fat Studios, [[Pete Atkin]], Maxine Guest, Claire Jennings, Terry Krejzl, Helen Nabarro, Lynda Ware *Producers: [[Carla Shelley]], Michael Rose *Associate Producer: Julie Lockhart *Executive Producers: [[Peter Lord]], [[David Sproxton]] *Written and Directed by: Peter Peake <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.keyframeonline.com/Animation/Humdrum/755/ |title=Humdrum |access-date=7 October 2018 |archive-date=12 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012201035/http://www.keyframeonline.com/Animation/Humdrum/755/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> ==See also== *[[List of stop-motion films]] *[[Silhouette animation]] (a similar technique but with the light coming from behind) ==External links== *[https://www.aardman.com/work/humdrum-clip/ Homepage] *{{IMDb title|0192145}} *[https://vimeo.com/91125489 ''Humdrum'' on Vimeo] ==References== {{Reflist}} {{Aardman Animations}} [[Category:1998 films]] [[Category:British animated short films]] [[Category:Stop-motion animated short films]] [[Category:1998 comedy films]] [[Category:1990s animated short films]] [[Category:British comedy short films]] [[Category:1990s stop-motion animated films]] [[Category:1990s English-language films]] [[Category:1990s British films]]",NA

As well as telling the story of an iconic man in the field of [[war photography]], the film addresses the broader scope of ideas common to all those involved in war journalism, as well as the issues that they cover. The documentary won a 2003 [[Peabody Award]], and was nominated for an [[74th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2002 and an [[Emmy Award]] in 2004. It also won or was nominated for more than 40 other awards internationally.<ref name=""official-site"">http://www.war-photographer.com/en (follow the ""Festivals and Awards"" link). Page accessed June 21, 2012.</ref> == Synopsis == One of the main themes of the documentary is the level to which a journalist should become involved in the events that they are there to document. [[James Nachtwey]] credits the intimacy of his photography to his emphasis on establishing a rapport with his subjects, often despite a significant language barrier. Des Wright, a cameraman with [[Reuters]], describes the problem of being too far removed from what is happening. Discussing a video reel of President [[Suharto]]'s resignation and a police crackdown on protestors, he notes: ""[Some journalists] say, 'I'm sorry, I'm a journalist, I'm not a part of this.' And I say, but you are a part of it. I think a lot of people would be quite happy for that man to be killed so they can get the particular picture that they want."" The documentary uses footage filmed with a small ""microcam"" video camera mounted on Nachtwey's [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] cameras. This allows the viewer to see the events from the perspective of the photographer. === Events and locations depicted in the film === * [[Kosovo War|Post-war]] [[Kosovo]] * [[Poverty]] and [[Jakarta Riots of May 1998|riots]] in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] <!-- I don't know if this is true, the site says May 1999 but there's sure rioting going on... --> * [[Ramallah]], the [[West Bank]] * A [[sulfur]] mine at [[Ijen]] in [[East Java]], Indonesia * [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]] * [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] * [[Thokoza]], [[South Africa]] ==Awards== *2003 [[Peabody Award]]{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} *Nominated for an [[74th Academy Awards|Academy Award]], 2002{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} *Nominated for an [[Emmy Award]], 2004{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} == Reception == ''War Photographer'' has an approval rating of 80% on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 25 reviews, and an average rating of 6.92/10.

James Nachtwey, the subject of the extraordinary ""War Photographer,"" not only belies that image but also stands so far apart from it that his idealism and monklike commitment are inspiring. (...) This film is an act of spiritual faith – an eloquent, deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/12/06/DD164809.DTL 6 December 2002], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''</ref>}} Ken Fox has estimated the humanistic approach of the film and of the work of James Nachtwey: {{Cquote|Frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who, in spite of all that he's witnessed, remains surprisingly idealistic, and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com TV Guide's Movie Guide, February 2003.]</ref>}} Similar Peter Rainer from ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'': {{Cquote|Nachtwey, in his mid-fifties and lanky, with a full shock of hair, has a cool, almost Zen-like deliberateness. He speaks slowly and carefully, as if he had long ago weighed his words, one by one, and was only now offering us their gravity. He has been photographing the globe's worst hot spots for 25 years and has probably seen up close more grief and ruination than anybody should have to see in a dozen lifetimes, and yet he still believes he's making a difference. He regards his photographs as an antidote to war, and himself as an antiwar photographer. (...) Nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you. He makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty.<ref>[http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/6139 New York Magazine, 24 June 2004.]</ref>}} == Notes == {{Reflist}} == External links == *{{Official website|warphotographer.christian-frei.info}} * {{IMDb title|0309061|War Photographer}} [[Category:2001 films]] [[Category:2001 documentary films]] [[Category:2000s English-language films]] [[Category:2000s German-language films]] [[Category:Swiss documentary films]] [[Category:Films shot in Indonesia]] [[Category:Films directed by Christian Frei]] [[Category:Documentary films about war photographers]] [[Category:2001 multilingual films]] [[Category:Swiss multilingual films]]"

The film also won the title of Best Animated Short at [[SIGGRAPH]] 2002 in [[San Antonio]]. ==Plot== The film focuses on a man who visits a mystical, organic building that looks like a medieval cathedral. As he walks through the immense structure, the light from his torch falls upon the pillars, revealing human faces. The viewer later realizes that the faces are still alive, as several smile and open their eyes as the man walks past them. The building's nature is partially unveiled at sunrise as the blinding light enchants the visitor and causes organic branch-like structures to burst from his chest. These protrusions then become another set of pillars in the building. ==Reception== The film was nominated in 2002 for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for the [[75th Academy Awards]]. The movie won the title of Best Animated Short at [[SIGGRAPH]] 2002 in [[San Antonio]] as well as several other awards.

As a consequence of the widespread poverty that came with the end of economic support from the former USSR, 37,191 Cubans left Cuba in 1994, unimpeded by the Cuban government, using anything they could find or build to get to [[Florida]] in the United States. Most left with improvised rafts, which were often not seaworthy, and some even hijacked a ferry. The documentary consists largely of interviews with the rafters (""Balseros""), over the course of seven years the lives of seven of those refugees, from the building of their rafts to their attempts at building new lives in the United States, giving insight into daily life in Cuba and the US in those days. The documentary is 2 hours long. The first half is filmed in Cuba, with in the end some scenes of the rafters' months long detention in [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]], where lotteries were used to decide who would be allowed to go to the US. All the while, their families didn't know their whereabouts. The last hour is about the lives of those who got to the USA. These people were filmed again five years later, showing their difficulties adapting to a new type of society and the resulting homesickness, a ""human adventure of people who are shipwrecked between two worlds"". ==Reception== ===Critical response=== ''Balseros'' has an approval rating of 88% on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 24 reviews, and an average rating of 7.46/10.

""Though he had agreed to become a member of the new government,"" wrote the translator and historian [[Ivan Morris]], ""it was clear from his writings and statements that he believed the ideals of the civil war were being [[:wikt:vitiate|vitiated]]. He was opposed to the excessively rapid changes in Japanese society and was particularly disturbed by the shabby treatment of the warrior class."" Suspicious of the new bureaucracy, he wanted power to remain in the hands of the samurai class and the Emperor, and for those reasons, he had joined the central government. ""Edicts like the interdiction against carrying swords and wearing the traditional topknot seemed like a series of gratuitous provocations; and, though Saigō realized that Japan needed an effective standing army to resist pressure from the West, he could not countenance the social implications of the military reforms. For this reason Saigō, although participating in the [[Okinoerabu]] government, continued to exercise a powerful appeal among disgruntled ex-samurai in [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and elsewhere."" Saigō fought for a moral revolution, not a material one, and he described his revolt as a check on the declining morality of a new, Westernizing materialism.<ref>Ivan Morris (1975), ''The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of japanese'', chapter 9, Saigō Takamori.

Set in [[Edo period|mid-19th century Japan]], a few years before the [[Meiji Restoration]], it follows the life of Seibei Iguchi, a low-ranking [[samurai]] employed as a bureaucrat. Poor, but not destitute, he still manages to lead a content and happy life with his daughters and his mother, who has dementia. Through an unfortunate turn of events, the turbulent times conspire against him. The film was inspired by the short story ""The Bamboo Sword"" by [[Shuhei Fujisawa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlpp.go.jp/en/works/01_21.html|title = The Bamboo Sword and Other Samurai Tales &#124; the 1st Selected Works &#124; Translation Works &#124; Japanese Literature Publishing Project:JLPP}}</ref> ''The Twilight Samurai'' won an unprecedented 12 [[Japanese Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay. ''The Twilight Samurai'' was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[76th Academy Awards]]. ==Plot== At the start of the film, the main character, Iguchi Seibei, becomes a widower when his wife succumbs to [[tuberculosis]]. His wife receives a grand funeral, more than Seibei, a low-ranking [[samurai]] can afford. Seibei works in the grain warehouse, keeping inventory for the [[clan]]. His samurai colleagues mock him behind his back with the nickname Tasogare (Twilight): when evening approaches, Seibei rushes home to look after his elderly mother, who has dementia, and two young daughters, Kayano and Ito, instead of bonding with his supervisor and other samurai colleagues over customary nights of dinner, [[geisha]] entertainment, and [[sake]] drinking. Even though he is a samurai, Seibei neglects his appearance, failing to bathe or shave his head, and being shabbily dressed. The well-being of his young daughters and medicine for his mother take priority over new clothes or the monthly bath fee, and his daughters say they are both happy, even without a mother. Things change when Seibei's childhood friend Tomoe (sister of Iinuma Michinojo, one of his better, kinder samurai friends and much higher ranked in the clan) returns to town. Tomoe is atypical in that she was a tom-boy as a child and as an adult questions points of etiquette, such as obeying her elder brother's wife and not attending peasant festivals. Recently divorced from an abusive alcoholic husband (Koda, a samurai captain), Tomoe finds comfort and solace with Seibei's daughters. Tomoe's ex-husband Koda barges into the household of Michinojo in the middle of night in a drunken demand for Tomoe and challenges Michinojo to a [[duel]] which Seibei accepts on Michinojo's behalf believing Michinojo could not win. This takes place with Seibei knowing his clan forbids duels and the penalty is usually death for the winner as the loser is already dead. Michinojo arrives before Seibei and is facing Koda. Seibei interrupts and decides to use only a wooden stick whilst Koda brandishes a steel [[katana]]. Koda, after being disarmed and asked if that can be the end of it, picks up his sword so Seibei knocks him unconscious, sparing both their lives. A few days later, Captain of the Guard Yogo passes by Seibei while Seibei is working in the stores and quietly announces he is friends with Koda who has asked him for help in seeking vengeance on Seibei. Recognising that Seibei has some skill and learning that Seibei has learnt a particular style of fighting Yogo hopes they can duel someday. Seibei's workmates learn of the duel and wonder if they should stop calling him by his nickname. When Iinuma Michinojo asks Seibei to marry his sister, saying she has turned down many offers and he will not force her, Seibei feels that Iinuma is teasing him for his strong feelings for Tomoe, like when he, Iinuma, and Tomoe were children. Iinuma knows Tomoe's feeling for Seibei, and Seibei is a kind man who would treat Tomoe better than Koda. With much deep regret, Seibei declines Iinuma's offer of his sister's hand in marriage, citing his inferior social status and how he did not want to see Tomoe share the burden of poverty despite Michinojo's protest that Tomoe is a grown woman who knows what she is up for. Seibei stoically regrets how his departed wife suffered in his care who, like Tomoe, came from a wealthier family. Iinuma talks no more of it. Tomoe stops visiting Kayano and Ito. In the final act, the ranking official of Seibei's clan, having heard of his prowess with a sword, orders Seibei to kill Yogo, who has been ""disowned"" and who stubbornly refuses to resign his post by committing [[seppuku]]. The young lord of the clan had died from measles and there was a succession struggle behind the scenes over who will be the new lord. Yogo ended up on the losing side of this conflict, hence his ordered suicide. Yogo has already killed a formidable samurai that was sent to kill him. Seibei is promised a rise in rank and pay if he accepts the dangerous mission. Seibei is very reluctant to fight Yogo at first, requesting one month to prepare for it. He says that, because of great hardship in his life, he has lost all resolve to fight with ferocity and disregard for his own life, because of the experience of watching his two girls grow. As they continue to insist, he requests two days to get himself up to the task. The new clan leader is furious over this answer and orders him expelled from the clan. Seibei is finally forced to agree to attempt the mission. Upon parting that evening, Seibei's supervisor (who was present during the meeting) promises him that he will make sure the girls will be taken care of if the worst comes to pass. The following morning, Seibei attempts to get ready, but there is no one to help him with the rituals of samurai before battle. With no one to turn to, he asks Tomoe for her assistance. Before he leaves, he tells Tomoe that he was wrong to decline the offer of marriage. He says that if he lives, he would like to ask for her hand in marriage now that there is promise of a promotion. She regretfully tells Seibei she has accepted another proposal. Seibei, feeling like a fool, tells Tomoe to forget about the silly conversation. Tomoe says that she will not be waiting at his household for him to return but that she hopes from her heart that he will return safely. Seibei says he understands completely. He thanks Tomoe for her generosity for assisting him in this final ritual. At Yogo's house, Seibei finds his target drinking alcohol in a dark, fly-infested room. Yogo recognizes Seibei and invites him to sit and drink. He then asks Seibei to allow him to run away. He explains he was only faithfully serving his master and describes how his wife and daughter also died of tuberculosis due to hardship and spending seven years as a [[Rōnin|ronin]]. Only thanks to his master's generosity could he afford a proper funeral. Yogo tells Seibei that he expects Seibei was promised a reward for this errand and that he too performed errands for his superior, taking the word of his superior as the word of the clan. Seibei commiserates and reveals further parallels in the two men's stories, such as that his wife's family demanded she have an expensive funeral and so he sold his katana to pay for it. He reveals that his long [[scabbard]] contains a fake bamboo sword. This angers Yogo who believes Seibei is mocking him: the short [[kodachi]] can be carried even by common people who are not samurai. Seibei explains he has been trained with the short sword, which he still carries, but Yogo is not placated. Seibei's [[kodachi]] fighting style is matched up against Yogo's [[ittō-ryū]] (single long sword) swordsmanship in an intense close quarters duel. Despite allowing Yogo to slash him several times and offering him chances to flee, Yogo presses the attack and Seibei kills Yogo when his longer sword gets caught in the rafters. Despite his wounds, Seibei limps home. Kayano and Ito rush to him in the courtyard, happy to see him. Tomoe is still there, waiting in the house. They have an emotional reunion. In a brief epilogue set many years later, Seibei's younger daughter, Ito, now elderly, visits the grave of Seibei and Tomoe. Narrating, she explains they married but that their happiness was not to last: He died three years later in the [[Boshin War]], Japan's last civil war. Tomoe took care of Seibei's daughters until they were both married. Ito often heard that Tasogare Seibei was a very unfortunate character, a most pathetic samurai with no luck at all. Ito disagrees: Her father never had any ambition to become anything special; he loved his two daughters, and was loved by the beautiful Tomoe. ==Cast== *[[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as Seibei Iguchi *[[Rie Miyazawa]] as Tomoe Iinuma *[[Nenji Kobayashi]] as Choubei Kusaka *[[Ren Osugi]] as Toyotarou Kouda *[[Mitsuru Fukikoshi]] as Michinojo Iinuma *Hiroshi Kanbe as Naota *Miki Itō as Kayano Iguchi *Erina Hashiguchi as Ito Iguchi *[[Reiko Kusamura]] as Iguchi's Mother *[[Min Tanaka]] as Zenemon Yogo *[[Keiko Kishi]] as Ito, as an old woman *[[Tetsuro Tamba]] as Tozaemon Iguchi ==Reception== ===Box office=== In Japan, the film grossed {{JPY|1.2 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|{{To USD|1200|JPN|year=2002}} million|long=no|link=yes}}) in 2002,<ref>{{cite web |title=過去興行収入上位作品 |url=http://www.eiren.org/toukei/2002.html |website=Eiren |publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan |year=2002 |language=ja |access-date=3 November 2020}}</ref> becoming the year's 16th top-grossing film at the Japanese box office.<ref>{{cite web |title=2002年（平成14年）興収10億円以上番組 |url=http://www.eiren.org/toukei/img/eiren_kosyu/data_2002.pdf |website=Eiren |publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan |year=2002 |language=ja |access-date=3 November 2020}}</ref> Overseas, the film grossed $593,547, including $559,765 in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=twilightsamurai.htm |title=Twilight Samurai (2004) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=2014-08-17}}</ref> This adds up to a total of {{US$|{{#expr:9570000+593547}}|long=no}} grossed worldwide. ===Critical reaction=== ''The Twilight Samurai'' has a rating of 99% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 70 reviews, and an average rating of 8.14/10, and is certified as ""Fresh"".

The screenplay, written by Mangold and [[Gill Dennis]], is based on two autobiographies by the American singer-songwriter [[Johnny Cash]]: ''[[Man in Black: His Own Story in His Own Words]]'' (1975) and ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]'' (1997). The film follows Cash's early life, his romance with the singer [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], his ascent in the country music scene, and his drug addiction. It stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Cash, [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Carter, [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Cash's first wife Vivian Liberto, and [[Robert Patrick]] as Cash's father. ''Walk the Line'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 4, 2005, and was theatrically released by [[20th Century Fox]] on November 18. It received positive reviews and grossed $187 million on a $28 million budget. At the [[78th Academy Awards]], the film won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Witherspoon) and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Phoenix), [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. ==Plot== <!-- Plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400–700 words. Please see WP: FILM PLOT for more information. --> In 1968, as an audience of inmates at [[Folsom State Prison]] cheer for [[Johnny Cash]], he waits backstage near a [[table saw]], reminding him of his early life. In 1944, 12-year-old Johnny is raised on a cotton farm in [[Dyess, Arkansas]], with his brother Jack, abusive father Ray, and mother Carrie. One day, Jack is killed in a sawmill accident while Johnny is out fishing; Ray blames Johnny for Jack’s death, saying that the [[Satan|Devil]] ""took the wrong son"". In 1950, Johnny enlists in the [[U.S. Air Force]] and is stationed in [[West Germany]]. He purchases a guitar, and in 1952, finds solace in writing songs, one of which he develops as ""[[Folsom Prison Blues]]"". After his discharge in 1954, Cash returns to the United States and marries his girlfriend, [[Vivian Liberto]]. The couple moves to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where Cash works as a door-to-door salesman to support his growing family, but with little success. He walks past a recording studio, which inspires him to organize a band to play [[gospel music]]. Cash's band auditions for [[Sam Phillips]], the owner of [[Sun Records]]. Phillips signs them after they play ""Folsom Prison Blues"", and the band begins touring as Johnny Cash and the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]], alongside fellow rising stars [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. On tour, Johnny meets [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], with whom he falls in love. They become friends, but June gently rebuffs his attempts to woo her. As Johnny’s fame grows, he starts abusing drugs and alcohol. Over Vivian's objections, Johnny persuades June to go tour with him. The tour is a success, but backstage, Vivian becomes critical of June's influence. After one performance in [[Las Vegas]], Johnny and June sleep together. The next morning, she notices Johnny taking pills, and doubts her choices. At that evening's concert, Johnny, upset by June's apparent rejection, behaves erratically and eventually passes out on stage. June disposes of Johnny's drugs, and begins to write ""[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]"", describing her feelings for him and her pain at watching him descend into addiction. Returning to [[California]], Johnny travels to [[Mexico]] to purchase more drugs and is arrested. Johnny’s marriage to Vivian implodes; they divorce and he moves to [[Nashville]] in 1966. Trying to reconcile with June, Johnny purchases a large house near a lake in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]]. His parents and the extended Carter family arrive for [[Thanksgiving]], at which time Ray and an intoxicated Johnny get into a bitter argument. After the meal, June's mother encourages her daughter to help Cash. He goes into detox and wakes with June; she says they have been given a second chance. They begin a tentative relationship, but June rebuffs his marriage proposals. Johnny discovers that most of his fan mail is from prisoners. He proposes to skeptical [[Columbia Records]] executives that he will record an [[At Folsom Prison|album live inside Folsom Prison]]. The performance is a success, and Johnny embarks on a tour with June and his band. He later performs ""Ring of Fire"" on stage. After the song, Cash invites June to a duet and stops in the middle, saying he cannot sing ""[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]"" any more unless June agrees to marry him. June accepts and they share a passionate embrace on stage. While Johnny and June are with their families, he and his father reconcile their relationship. ==Cast== <!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits (11 credited), next five (up to random ""young xx""), and roles as written per closing credits scroll ---> {{div col}} * [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as [[Johnny Cash]] * [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]] * [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as [[Vivian Cash]] * [[Robert Patrick]] as Ray Cash * McGhee Monteith as Reba Cash * [[Dallas Roberts]] as [[Sam Phillips]] * [[Dan John Miller]] as [[Luther Perkins]] * [[Larry Bagby]] as [[Marshall Grant]] * [[Shelby Lynne]] as Carrie Cash * [[Tyler Hilton]] as [[Elvis Presley]] * [[Waylon Payne]] as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] * [[Shooter Jennings]] as [[Waylon Jennings]] * Sandra Ellis Lafferty as [[Maybelle Carter]] * Dan Beene as [[Ezra Carter]] * Clay Steakley as [[W.

He also lauded Malick as a ""visionary"". [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' hailed the film as ""a masterpiece"", while others such as [[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' gave positive reviews. On the other hand, [[Stephen Hunter]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' faulted the film for being ""stately almost to the point of being static"", while [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized it as ""sluggish"", ""underdramatized"", and ""emotionally remote"". While its release was timed for consideration for the awards season, it was nominated only for the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] for [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. In November 2009, ''[[Time Out New York]]'' ranked the film as the fourth-best of the decade, saying: <blockquote>The particular power of this [[tone poem]] comes from how quietly resigned both characters are to their fates, as if they sense a guiding hand in their every action. The final passages of Malick's [[idyll]], after Pocahontas takes a fateful ocean journey, are the finest work of his career, most notably in his portrayal of the princess's death and transfiguration—a shattering five-minute sequence that never fails to move.""<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/film/80947/the-tony-top-50-movies-of-the-decade/6.html | title = The TONY top 50 movies of the decade | magazine = [[Time Out New York]] | issue = 739 | date =November 26 – December 2, 2009 | access-date = 2009-12-02}}</ref></blockquote> In January 2010, Mick LaSalle of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' designated it the No. 1 film of the decade. <blockquote>Terence Malick's one-of-a-kind film, about the life of Pocahontas and the dawn of American history, contains some of the best filmmaking imaginable – some of it beyond imagining. I have seen it at least five times and have no idea how Malick knew, when he put it all together, that the movie would even make sense. It's difficult to write a great short poem. It's difficult to write a great long novel. But to write a great long poem that's the size of a great long novel – one that makes sense, doesn't flag and is exponentially better than the short poem or the long novel ever would have been – that's almost impossible. Malick did it.

And that film is ''The New World'', Terrence Malick's American foundation myth, which arrived just as the decade reached its dismal halfway point, in January 2006. [...] ''The New World'' is a bottomless movie, almost unspeakably beautiful and formally harmonious. The movie came and went within a month, and its critical reception was characterised for the most part by bafflement, condescension, lazy ridicule and outright hostility. [...] Its siblings are to be found throughout movie history and across all national and stylistic boundaries, from the silents to [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[James Benning (film director)|James Benning]] and [[Stan Brakhage]], or in ''[[Winstanley (film)|Winstanley]]'' and ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''. Its cultural hinterland is made up not just of other movies, but of [[Buddhism]], [[ethnography]] and [[Realism (arts)#Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects|naturalism]], Wagner, Mozart and the structural forms of classical music, Malick's enthusiasm for bird-watching, and a helping of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] [...] It is both ancient and modern, cinema at its purest and most organic, its simplest and most refined [...].<ref>{{cite news |access-date=2012-01-24 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/10/the-new-world-terrence-malick |title=The New World: a misunderstood masterpiece? |newspaper=The Guardian|date=December 10, 2009 |last1=Patterson |first1=John }}</ref></blockquote> In a contribution to ''The cinema of Terrence Malick: Poetic visions of America'', film scholar [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]] writes: <blockquote>By the end of ''The New World'', it seemed to me, I had experienced something like a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Mass in B minor]]'' or a poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].

Despite this less than favorable reception, it received four nominations for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] and received other notable nominations and awards. In a 2018 interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Rob Marshall revealed that he believes the Weinstein Company failed to market the film properly as it was a trickier sell than ''Chicago'' and should have started in festivals and smaller venues. He also said, “I did feel somewhat compromised working on it. Everything on the screen wasn’t fully my perfect version of it.”<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-rob-marshall-made-mary-poppins-sing-again | title=How Rob Marshall Made Mary Poppins Sing Again | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=December 13, 2018 }}</ref> == Accolades == {| class=""wikitable"" !

Through the portrayal of Andreotti, the movie displays how political actors are able to maintain their position and power with little to no explanation as to how they did so. Also, the inability to completely distinguish whether Andreotti was or was not affiliated with the Mafia murders conveys the lack of clarity in the mechanics of Italy's government. Andreotti's incumbency reveals the [[pentapartito]], which consisted of five parties ranging from centre-right to centre-left. This coalition formed to prevent a left majority and was able to secure a majority by strategic methods of give and take. By maintaining this system of taking turns, a ""systematic corruption"" formed where parties were no longer driven by the masses, but by their alignments, resulting in ""exchanging resources"".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bull|first1=Martin|last2=Rhodes|first2=Martin|title=Between crisis and transition: Italian politics in the 1990s|journal=West European Politics|volume=20|pages=1–13|doi=10.1080/01402389708425172|year=1997}}</ref> ==Critical reception== ''Il Divo'' received mostly positive reviews from critics.

One day he gives her a toy ring to show his affection. But heartbreak ensues when he bumps into Miss Purdy and her boyfriend having just bought a very real engagement ring. Devastated and spurned, Ardal challenges Miss Purdy’s fiancé to a duel to the death. ==Plot== Eight-year-old Ardal Travis has a crush on his second grade class teacher, Ms. Purdy, and demonstrates his love by giving her a toy ring. Subsequently, while out shopping with his mother, Ardal sees Ms. Purdy, who happily explains to them that she and her boyfriend Pierce have just become engaged to be married. Pierce appears to be a jerk; he refuses to take Ms. Purdy for lunch to celebrate the hour-old engagement, insisting instead on going home to watch the football. That evening Ardal sees his dad put a gun carefully in the closet, at which he stares contemplating his options. Some days later, Ardal confronts Pierce while Pierce is impatiently waiting for Ms. Purdy outside of the school. Ardal challenges Pierce to a duel to the death, which Pierce mockingly accepts. The next day, Ardal meets Pierce in the school yard. Pierce forgets his gun on purpose and Ardal pulls a gun on him. Pierce at first believes it to be a toy, but Ardal insists it is not. Ms. Purdy attempts to intervene but Ardal refuses to back down. Pierce, by now genuinely concerned for his own safety, becomes irate and is finally reduced to a crying mess, ultimately confessing that he never loved Ms. Purdy but only proposed to her to “shut her up"". Ardal shoots the gun, the scene blacks out momentarily, and then returns with Pierce having fallen to the ground, but with eyes open. It is revealed that the gun was a toy, after all, one that Ardal’s father was saving in his closet until his birthday. Ms. Purdy angrily calls off the engagement and breaks up with Pierce. She protectively walks Ardal out, agreeing to “keep this between ourselves"". Ardal then tells Ms. Purdy that he has decided not to marry her after all because he is ""not financially stable enough to cater for all [her] needs"" adding that ""someone as nice as you should have everything she wants"". Charmed - even moved - by his earnest innocence and yet, despite herself, somehow still impressed by his precociousness, she says: ""Come on Romeo, I'll get you home"". As they walk off into the distance she places an affectionate hand fleetingly on his shoulder. At the beginning of the movie Ms. Purdy had asked her students to look up the three words 'reveal', 'pretend' and 'love'; concepts which, we now see, may be thought to encapsulate the entire film. ==Accolades== The film was awarded Best Irish Short at the 23rd [[Foyle Film Festival]].<ref name=Belfast /> On 25 January 2011, it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/entertainment/irish-film-the-crush-nominated-for-best-live-action-short-490756.html |title=Irish film ''The Crush'' nominated for Best Live Action Short |date=25 January 2011 |work=Breakingnews.ie |accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0125/oscars.html |title=The King's Speech leads Oscar nominations |date=25 January 2011 |work=RTÉ News |accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * {{IMDb title|1509756|The Crush}} * ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100814140453/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/crush-film29535.html The Crush]'' at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Crush}} [[Category:2010 films]] [[Category:2010 short films]] [[Category:English-language Irish films]] [[Category:Films set in Ireland]] [[Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland]] [[Category:2010s English-language films]] [[Category:Irish short films]]",NA

It was directed by [[Tanel Toom]], and written by Caroline Bruckner and Tanel Toom. The film follows a boy named Sam who can't think of any sins to tell the priest at his first confession. He worries that he won't be a real Catholic if the priest doesn't absolve him of some misdeed. Jacob, Sam's friend, devises a solution in the form of a prank, but the result is tragic. == Plot == Sam, an eight-year-old attending a Catholic school, and his trouble making friend Jacob prepare for their first confession. Their class is given a list of sins that children can confess. These include ""bullying"" and ""swearing"" among others. Sam pores over the list but is unable to come up with a sin he has done. Sam asks Jacob what he will confess. Jacob states that he would mention not listening to his mother and locking his sister in the closet. Sam feels like he will not be a true Catholic if he cannot be absolved, so he turns to Jacob to suggest a sin Sam could commit and then confess to. Jacob and Sam decide to steal Farmer Collins’ Scarecrow and leave it in the middle of the road for him to find while he is driving his tractor to town, committing the sin of ""stealing."" The plan backfires when Farmer Collins pulls off the main road before he sees the stolen scarecrow. As soon as the farmer leaves, however, another car speeds down the twisted and deserted street and, believing the scarecrow to be a dead body, swerves to avoid it and crashes into a tree. Sam walks up to the steaming car and sees a woman and a little girl alive, but severely dazed and bleeding from the head. The car bursts into flames, while Sam and Jacob flee the scene with the scarecrow. As they are running through the woods, the vehicle explodes in the distance. Sam and Jacob dump the scarecrow off the cliff by the tree they play by every day. Jacob makes Sam swear never to tell anyone because ""it was an accident."" Sam is full of guilt. That night he dreams the dead woman, the farmer and his father all know. He is haunted by what he has done. In school the next day Sam runs out of his class into the bathroom, unable to deal with what he has done. Jacob runs after him and tells him that no one knows that he has to keep it together. Jacob tells Sam to meet him at the tree where they hid the scarecrow after dinner. During dinner that night Sam’s father mentions that Collins’ scarecrow was missing, leading guilt striven Sam to believe that his father knows what he has done. After dinner he meets Jacob by the tree. Sam wants to tell someone what has happened. Jacob states that if he does Jacob will deny everything because it was Sam’s fault. The two boys start pushing each other, while Sam yells over and over again ""it’s not my fault, it’s not my fault."" During the fight Sam accidentally pushes Jacob into the same cliff they dumped the scarecrow the day before, killing him. The next day Sam goes to church early in the morning in his robes to have his first confession. While the Priest states that confession does not start until later, Sam insists that he confess his sins now. The Priest, seeing that something is clearly troubling Sam, agrees. Sam states ""Bless me father for I have sinned, this is my first confession."" The Priest gently asks Sam to name his sins. With tears streaming down his face Sam, unable to say all he has done, confesses not listening to his mother and locking his sister in the closet, the same sins his now deceased friend Jacob was going to confess. The Priest declares Sam’s sins to be absolved. The scene changes to the empty cross in the field and then fades to black. ==Cast== *[[Lewis Howlett]] as Sam, an 8-year-old, Catholic schoolboy, Sam is a good kid with a conscience who prefers to follow the rules. However, his friend Jacob often leads him astray. *[[Joe Eales]] as Jacob, Sam's friend and classmate, Jacob questions conventions. He has a mischievous streak, and ultimately, he lacks a conscience. *[[James Simmons (actor)|James Simmons]] as the priest *[[Gemma Atkins]] as the teacher *[[Aran Bell]] as Sam's father == Awards and nominations == {| class=""wikitable"" style=""text-align: center;"" |- ! style=""width: 33px; background: #ecc850;"" | Year ! style=""width: 200px; background: #ecc850;"" | Ceremony ! style=""width: 100px; background: #ecc850;"" | Award ! style=""width: 100px; background: #ecc850;"" | Result ! style=""width: 200px; background: #ecc850;"" | Category |- | 2011 | [[Academy Awards]] | [[Academy Award|Oscar]] | Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/83/nominees.html |title=Nominees for the 83rd Academy Awards |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref> | [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Short Film (Live Action)]] |- | 2011 | [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|MPSE Golden Reels Awards]] | [[Verna Fields Award]] | Nominated | Best Sound Editing in a Student Film |- | 2010 | [[Student Academy Awards]] | Student Oscar | Won | Honorary Foreign Film |} ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * [http://www.oscars.org/video/watch/37saa_for_confession.html ''The Confession'' excerpt] hosted at Oscars.org * {{IMDb title|1687903|The Confession}} * [http://vimeo.com/13331738 Watch the full film.] {{DEFAULTSORT:Confession}} [[Category:2010 films]] [[Category:2010 short films]] [[Category:British short films]] [[Category:2010s English-language films]]",NA

It follows a German couple who adopt a little boy<ref name=""jn""/> who they believe to be an orphan from Calcutta, India.<ref name=""dlf""/> When he goes missing on the second day, they realize that his parents are still alive and that he has been abducted from his family. The story details their dramatic response to the discovery. == Plot == The Caucasian couple Sarah and Jan Fischer travel to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India, to adopt a 4-year-old supposedly orphan child, Raju, at a children's home.<ref name=""fw""/> Formalities require a minimum stay of four days. On the second day Jan and Raju take a trip to the city. When Jan briefly turns around, Raju goes missing on a market. First, the couple turns to the authorities. While Sarah being ill returns and stays at their hotel, Jan searches the streets on his own.<ref name=""fw""/> In the evening not having found Raju, Jan takes a cab back to the hotel. He suddenly spots a boy wearing the same jersey as Raju did. Jan finally catches up with the boy mistaken as Raju at a community center. The manager offers the community organization's help in finding Raju, too. While in a different room the manager is sending out their missing person report to cooperating organizations, Jan casually browses a paper folder of reports. He recognizes the picture of a girl he saw at the children's home. Surprised, he browses the folder more carefully and finds out that Raju has been reported missing before, meaning that Raju is in fact not an orphan.<ref name=""fw""/> In the same night Jan heads back to the children's home and challenges the manager. She dares him to incriminate himself when he reports the police that they attempted to adopt a ''kidnapped'' child.<ref name=""fw""/> The police finds and returns Raju to the Fischer family, yet now Sarah and Jan are struggling and arguing about the ethical implications of their action.

Richie cancels his plans and sets out to babysit his niece. When he meets Sophia, she makes it clear that she has no interest in talking to him, nor does she seem to care much about him. Richie mentions that he drew flipbooks when he was younger, starring a protagonist named ""Sophia"", and that he wonders if his sister got Sophia’s name from those flipbooks. He then takes Sophia to an old rundown building where he used to live, and finds the flipbooks he wants to show her, but Sophia gets scared and wants to go home. After Richie apologizes, they return to the bowling alley and Sophia starts asking all about his life. They start to become friends, and Richie admits that the reason he hasn't been allowed to see her all these years is because he once dropped Sophia on her head while taking care of her as a baby. Sophia finds this incident amusing, just as her favorite song comes on over the loudspeakers. Suddenly, everyone in the bowling alley seems to be dancing along with the song, except for Richie. Sophia begs him to dance with her, tugging at his arm until his wrist comes out of its sleeve, revealing his suicide attempt. Richie snaps back to reality. When Richie brings Sophia back home, he notices a restraining order sitting on the kitchen table, citing assault and harassment. His sister comes back looking bruised and she thanks Richie for his help, but she wants him to leave. She doesn’t want her daughter having any more ""false idols"". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger, and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns home to his bathtub, and attempts to continue what he started in the beginning but Maggie interrupts him with a phone call again, this time on nicer terms. ==Awards== {| class=""wikitable"" style=""text-align: center"" |----- bgcolor=""#94bfd3"" | colspan=4 align=center | '''Awards for ''Curfew'' |----- bgcolor=""#94bfd3"" !width=""90""|'''Year''' !width=""250""|'''Association''' !width=""300""|'''Award Category''' !width=""90""|'''Status''' |- | rowspan=10|[[2013 in film|2013]] | [[85th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] | Best Short Film - Live Action | {{Won}} |- | Prescott Film Festival | Best Narrative Short Film | {{Won}} |- | Cortopolis | Audience Award | {{Won}} |- | Lakecity International Short Film Festival | Best Foreign Film | {{Won}} |- |[[Hill Country Film Festival|Hill County Film Festival]] | Best Short Film | {{Won}} |- | rowspan=""2"" | Vaughan Film Festival | Best Short Film | {{Won}} |- | Best Actress | {{won}} |- | Film Caravan | Audience Award | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""2"" | Rincon International Film Festival | Best Actress | {{won}} |- | Best Short Film | {{won}} |- | rowspan=37|[[2012 in film|2012]] |[[Stockholm International Film Festival]] | Best Short Film | {{won}} |- |[[Nashville Film Festival]] | Best Narrative Short Film | {{won}} |- |[[Cleveland International Film Festival]] | Best Live Action Short Film | {{won}} |- |[[Woodstock Film Festival]] | Best Short Narrative | {{won}} |- | [[Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival]] | Audience Award (International) | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""2"" | [[Brussels Short Film Festival]] | Best Actor | {{won}} |- | Audience Award (International) | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""2"" | Ozu International Film Festival | Grand Jury Prize | {{won}} |- | Audience Award | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""2"" | Sapporo Short Film Festival | Best Young Actress | {{won}} |- | Audience Award | {{won}} |- | Granada International Film Festival | Best International Short Film | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""3"" | Seattle Shorts Film Festival | Grand Jury Prize | {{won}} |- | Best Director | {{won}} |- | Best Actor | {{won}} |- | Short Shorts Film Festival | Audience Award (International) | {{won}} |- | Tacoma Film Festival | Best Narrative Short Film | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""3"" | 24fps Int'l Short Film Festival | Best Actor | {{won}} |- | Silver Medal | {{won}} |- | Audience Award | {{won}} |- | 15 Short Film Festival | Audience Award | {{won}} |- | Concorto Film Festival | Youth Jury Award | {{won}} |- | La Boca Del Lobo Int'l Film Festival | Best International Short Film | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""4"" | Soria International Short Film Festival | Best Screenplay | {{won}} |- | Grand Jury Prize (International) | {{won}} |- | Audience Award | {{won}} |- | Youth Jury Award (International) | {{won}} |- |[[Windsor International Film Festival]] | Can-Am People's Choice Award | {{won}} |- | Williamstown Film Festival | Christopher Reeve Audience Award | {{won}} |- |[[Saguenay International Short Film Festival]] | Creativity Prize | {{won}} |- | Abitibi-Temiscamingue Int'l Film Festival | Best Short Film | {{won}} |- | rowspan=""4"" | Du Grain a Demoudre Film Festival | Best Short Screenplay | {{won}} |- | Audience Award | {{won}} |- | Young Cinephiles Award | {{won}} |- | Jean Prevost High School Award | {{won}} |- | Sequence Short Film Festival | Audience Award (International) | {{won}} |- |[[Port Townsend Film Festival]] | Special Jury Commendation | {{won}} |- |} ==Release== The film was released in February 2013 on [[iTunes]] and in a theatrical run with the other 14 Oscar-nominated short films by [[ShortsHD]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Oscar Nominated Short Films 2013|year=2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/02/01/movies/awardsseason/oscar-shorts.html}}</ref> ==References== {{reflist}} ==External links== * {{official website|http://curfewfilm.com}} * {{IMDb title|2088735}} {{Shawn Christensen}} {{AcademyAwardBestShort 2001–2020}} [[Category:2012 films]] [[Category:Indiegogo projects]] [[Category:Live Action Short Film Academy Award winners]] [[Category:2012 short films]] [[Category:2012 drama films]] [[Category:2010s English-language films]] [[Category:American drama short films]] [[Category:Films directed by Shawn Christensen]] [[Category:2010s American films]] {{short-film-stub}}",NA

It tells the story of Pig, an introverted youth who lives in a windmill and keeps a dark fog from engulfing his town. Although socially rejected by his peers, he is befriended by the artistic Fox. Kondo and Tsutsumi began developing the film while working as [[art directors]] on ''[[Monsters University]]'' and produced it through a co-op program at [[Pixar]]. This is Tsutsumi's second short film, after 2011's ''Sketchtravel'', and Kondo's first directorial effort. Producers Megan Bartel and Duncan Ramsay were also employees at Pixar. The film received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]. ==Plot== Pig lives alone in a [[windmill]] on the outskirts of town. The windmill sits atop a massive wall and continually blows away a dark fog that perpetually looms outside the wall. Every day, Pig winds the windmill to keep it turning, just like his father before him. However, in town and at school, nobody likes Pig. Even though he protects the town, the other animal children make fun of him and bully him. Soon, a new student, Fox, arrives at the school carrying a sketchbook and quickly becomes rather popular. One day, she mistakingly drops the sketchbook while leaving the classroom, and Pig discovers that Fox draws mocking [[caricature]]s of classmates and teachers. Fox shows up the next day upset about losing the sketchbook, but she is quickly relieved to see that Pig has it with him. That day at school, bullies drag Pig into the restroom and harass him. Fox discovers Pig in the restroom, and consoles him and teaches him to use art as an emotional outlet for his daily hardships. The two become good friends. After school one day, Pig notices Fox surrounded by several other students looking at one of her drawings and laughing. Emboldened, Pig approaches the group. Through the crowd, Pig barely sees a mean-looking caricature of himself, with ""Dirty P-"" written at the top. Devastated, Pig rips the drawing out of Fox's sketchbook and runs away in tears. As evening continues, the fog draws near - Pig should be returning to his home to wind the windmill. Instead, sitting in sorrow, he puts on his gas mask and waits as the fog envelops the town while the other animals flee in terror. Eventually, Pig looks down at the drawing and discovers that he is not the only one caricatured—Fox is next to him, and the title is actually ""Dirty Pals"". Jolted back to his senses, Pig realizes what horrible risk the town is in. He makes his way to the windmill and manages to rid the town of the fog, losing and damaging one of the mill's propellers in the process. Pig gazes out the window of the windmill as the fog clears and the citizens begin cleaning up. Pig remembers the drawing and begins to leave. Upon opening the door, Fox is waiting for him. Pig acknowledges his misunderstanding, and she extends forgiveness to him. The two then play together inside the windmill. ==Cast== * [[Lars Mikkelsen]] as Narrator ==Production== ===Development=== [[File:Pixaranimationstudios.jpg|thumb|Directors Robert Kondo and Daisuke ""Dice"" Tsutsumi developed ''The Dam Keeper'' under a co-op program at Pixar.]] ''The Dam Keeper'' was produced as part of a [[co-op]] program at [[Pixar]], under which employees are allowed to develop their own films without the use of studio resources.<ref name=""Mashable"">{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/17/the-dam-keeper-pixar/|author=Samantha Murphy Kelly|title=How 2 Animators Independently Recreated Pixar Magic|work=[[Mashable]]|date=April 17, 2014|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}</ref> Directors [[Robert Kondo]] and [[Daisuke Tsutsumi|Daisuke ""Dice"" Tsutsumi]] were both [[art director]]s at Pixar.

However, Ramsay feared that balancing a project like this, on the side of his regular Pixar duties, would prove an unmanageable workload. So initially, he turned the offer down. All the same, he found himself gradually being drawn into the project, and once he committed full-scale, he convinced his friend, Megan Bartel, to come onto the film as a producer with him.

""He [Back] always had something to say. For him, figuring out what was happening in society came first, before his craft"", Tsutsumi said.<ref name=""Japan Times""/> Although the two directors did not seek to make a ""social statement"" with their film, commentary on world issues flowed naturally into their story. ""[W]e tried hard to stay true to who we are"", Tsutsumi said.<ref name=""Japan Times""/> [W]e are very conscious of what is happening today.""<ref name=""Japan Times""/> Kondo has named [[Don Bluth]] as one of his influences, and both have named [[Hayao Miyazaki]] (Tsutsumi's uncle through marriage), as well as the films of [[Walt Disney]] - in particular, ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Dumbo]]'', and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''.<ref name=""Japan Times""/> Many people have asked Kondo if Pig was based on him, and if Fox was based on Tsutsumi. However, each character was actually based on both filmmakers. ""I think Pig might be who we are, but Fox is who we want to be"", Tsutsumi explained.<ref name=""NY Times""/> He described himself and Kondo as both being ""somewhat introverted"".<ref name=""NY Times""/> Although he supposes that they are not quite as introverted as Pig, he feels that many artists are.<ref name=""NY Times""/> A [[test screening]] of the first [[story reel]] was organized for a group of Kondo and Tsutsumi's friends who had more writing experience than the two former art directors. As described by Kondo, the screening was ""a disaster.""<ref name=""Crisis"" /> The two directors recognized for themselves that the story was not working as they had wanted it to. ""That was devastating"", Tsutsumi said.<ref name=""Crisis"" /> The story was coming across as overly ""heady"" and did not connect emotionally.<ref name=""Crisis"" /> Although Kondo and Tsutsumi had wanted to finalize the story before starting production, they now had to revise it, while concurrently working on other aspects of the film.

He has said that he only hopes to be ""more nimble"" in dealing with them in the future.<ref name=""Crisis"" /> One scene was cut from the finished film.

At first, the animators made little progress. ""We went from at least the two of us painting every day and producing things for the film, to none of us"", Kondo remarked on the situation. Not a single frame of the film was produced during the first month. The directors later described this moment as ""terrifying"".<ref name=""Painters""/> They began to worry that the film would never see completion. However, in a sudden turn, the animators began accomplishing more than their directors had ever anticipated of them. ""Literally in a day...we went from zero to exceeding output for a week...expectations for what our production could be just exploded"", Kondo said.<ref name=""Painters""/> The animators learned certain techniques even faster than Kondo and Tsutsumi had.

Because Box is able to save each version of a file, no one had to ""worry about losing anything"", Kondo explained.<ref name=""Mashable""/> This helped him and Tsutsumi keep track of everything that was going on in the production. Kondo noted that without the ease of ""communication, information organization and collaboration"" provided by new technology, the film ""would have had to have changed in scope, complexity and quality to be able to be done"" on schedule.""<ref name=""Mashable""/> He feels that this would have been impossible to accomplish a decade earlier.<ref name=""Mashable""/> ===Music=== The film's score was composed by Zach Johnston and Matteo Roberts.<ref name=""Score Featurette"">{{cite AV media|people=Robert Kondo; Daisuke Tsutsumi; Zach Johnston; Matteo Roberts; Minna Choi|date=May 5, 2014|title= Making The Dam Keeper #05: Score Featurette|type=video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lIdBUCWb6Q|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> Johnston had previously collaborated with the directors on Tsutsumi's ''Sketchtravel'', as a composer and co-writer.<ref name=""Score Featurette""/><ref>{{cite video|date=2011|title=Sketchtravel - ''Credits''}}</ref> The four would often converse over [[Skype]]. Kondo and Tsutsumi have no musical background, but felt that they were ""in great hands"" with their composers.<ref name=""Score Featurette""/> They were upfront about their lack of expertise in this area. When making suggestions for the score, they would acknowledge that their ideas might not be worth using. However, Johnston and Roberts both feel that the directors made valuable musical contributions. Johnston remarked that the directors made the score ""more elegant and subtle"" than it would have been otherwise.<ref name=""Score Featurette""/> Noting the importance of this point, Roberts said that because Pig's pain has become normalized in his life, the score should only reflect ""a tinge of sadness"" and not be ""overly dramatic"".<ref name=""Score Featurette""/> Both composers greatly enjoyed their time on the film. They felt a considerable amount of freedom in crafting the score and found that there was no pressure to mimic the sound of other composers. After completing the film, Johnston joked that his and Roberts' careers would be ""all down hill from here...unless Dice and Robert ask us to do another one.""<ref name=""Score Featurette""/> The [[Demo (music)|demo score]] was created and recorded on [[Apple (company)|Apple]]'s [[GarageBand]].<ref name=""Mashable""/> Minna Choi then conducted MagicMagic Orchestra in performing the score live. They recorded at Fantasy Studios in [[Berkeley, California]]. The studio room contained a screen that would show corresponding scenes. Many of the instrumentalists found that they could not watch this without being overcome with emotion. As such, they had to avert their eyes. Tsutsumi related a moment when Choi was explaining the film's story to the orchestra, and he found her moved to tears. For his part, Kondo found it ""mesmerizing"" to watch Choi conduct.<ref name=""Score Featurette""/> ""There's something about watching someone who's incredible at their craft"", he said.<ref name=""Score Featurette""/> Commenting on Johnston and Roberts' score, Choi called it ""tender"", ""sweet"", and ""innocent"".<ref name=""Score Featurette""/> ===Post-production=== When Kondo and Tsutsumi completed production on ''The Dam Keeper'', they found themselves restless at Pixar. ""Of course they were great to us"", Kondo said of his friends at the studio.<ref name=""Variety""/> ""They're our family still, but...if we didn't go back to [independent filmmaking] and challenge ourselves...in the end not only would we suffer but Pixar would suffer as well.""<ref name=""Variety""/> He and Tsutsumi made the difficult decision of leaving their employment behind. Tsutsumi was a new father at the time. Kondo was soon to be married.<ref name=""Variety""/> Friends and family questioned them. However, the duo had grown deeply enamored with the experience of making films on their own. When they had first set out to direct ''The Dam Keeper'', they had been looking for something that could mirror the early days of Pixar. ""Creating something from scratch is what 'creating' means"", Tsutsumi explained.<ref name=""NY Times""/> ""We didn't experience that beginning and, if we stayed at Pixar, we never would.""<ref name=""NY Times""/> The two of them felt they had learned more in the nine months that it took to produce ''The Dam Keeper'' than in all of their previous years as art directors. They did not want this rewarding period of their lives to only last for a short while.<ref name=""Variety""/> Recognizing that it would only become harder with the passing years to go out on their own, Kondo and Tsutsumi resigned from Pixar in July 2014.<ref name=""Variety""/> From there, they founded their own studio, [[Tonko House]].<ref name=""NY Times""/><ref name=""Variety""/> Although they would eventually move locations to [[Berkeley, California]], at first Tonko House was situated within the same windowless studio that ''The Dam Keeper'' was produced in - right across the street from Pixar. Kondo and Tsutsumi invited their former boss and mentor, [[Ed Catmull]], over for a visit. He gave the duo his blessing, saying, ""This is the moment you'll remember no matter what it turns into, no matter how big it becomes...that first moment, when you create something from nothing, is the best time.""<ref name=""NY Times""/> Tonko House derives its name from the Japanese words for pig (ton) and fox (ko).<ref name=""Variety""/><ref name=""Japan Times"">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/01/30/general/less-year-tonko-house-earns-oscar-nomination/#.VPz7RGjF98H|author=Roland Kelts|title=In less than a year, Tonko House earns an Oscar nomination|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=January 30, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}</ref> It was not the first name that Kondo and Tsutsumi considered, but all of their other ideas were already taken.

His job is to salvage valuables from the clothing of corpses, drag them from the [[gas chambers]] and scrub the gas chambers before the next group of victims arrives to be murdered. He works stoically, seemingly having been numbed by the daily attrocities. Among the dead after a gassing, Saul sees a boy who is still barely alive suffocated by a Nazi doctor who calls for an autopsy on the boy. Saul steps forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, [[Miklós Nyiszli]], a fellow Hungarian prisoner and a forced assistant to [[Josef Mengele]]. He asks Miklós to not cut up the boy, so he can give him a proper Jewish burial. Miklós declines, but says he can have five minutes alone with the boy tonight, before the cremation. Saul goes in search of a Rabbi to perform the funeral ritual. He goes to Rabbi Frankel in the crematorium, who dismisses Saul's concern and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself. Saul overhears ''Sonderkommando'' Abraham talk about an uprising against the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-guards with ''[[Oberkapo]]'' Biederman ([[Urs Rechn]]). Biederman first wants to photograph the camp's horrors using a camera collected from the clothing of an earlier murdered caravan, and smuggle the [[Sonderkommando photographs|pictures]] outside to attract attention and help. Saul asks for another rabbi and Abraham tells him of ""the Renegade,"" a Greek Rabbi who has lost his faith. Saul in return offers his assistance in their plan and is instructed to go with a prisoner (Katz) to repair a shack; he is given a piece of jewellery for use as a bribe in case he's caught. When Saul and Katz arrive at the shack, Saul pretends to fix the front door's lock, while Katz takes out a camera from inside the shack and starts to take pictures of the cremation. Saul hears the guards and hides the camera outside in a drain. The guards search the shack, only to find nothing. Saul then sneaks onto a truck for another ''Sonderkommando'' unit, heading to a nearby riverbank, where the ashes from the crematoria are dumped into the river. Saul finds the Renegade, who refuses to help him. Saul then threatens to alert the ''Oberkapo'' of the unit, Mietek, that the Renegade is a rabbi by reciting a [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish blessing]]. When the Renegade refuses yet again Saul throws the man's shovel into the water. The rabbi jumps into the river to retrieve the shovel or drown himself. Saul, who can't swim, manages to bring the Renegade back to the riverbank and both are then taken to the SS-commandant of the unit. After an interrogation, the Renegade is executed and Saul is allowed to go back to the unit. Saul is then confronted by Mietek, who realizes that he is from another unit. To mollify Mietek, Saul gives him the piece of jewellery. Back at the concentration camp, following roll call, Saul sneaks into Miklós's office where he is caught by a group of Nazi officers. One of them pushes Saul around like a puppet and makes a mockery of [[Jewish dances]], finally forcing him out of the room. After searching in vain for the boy's body, Saul confronts Miklós, who assures him that he has hidden it from the other doctors for safety. Saul sneaks into the autopsy room and takes the body back to his own barrack in a sack. That night, Saul is summoned to clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll. Biederman walks in and is ordered to write up a list of seventy names. This leads Biederman to believe that his unit will soon be killed. Biederman discloses the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp, where he will pick up a smuggled package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, it is clear they know each other. She calls him by name and clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. Saul, again, looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun as a member of the ''Sonderkommando'' and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the murdered boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true. The next morning during roll call, Miklós finds Saul and tells him that he needs a replacement body, similar to the one Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biederman and his unit have been murdered by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's corpse and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the ''[[Kaddish]]''. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the corpse floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the [[Home Army|Polish resistance]]. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. The boy runs away, and makes it a short distance before an SS officer grabs and silences him as guards run past in the direction of the shed. When they have all passed, the officer releases him, and the boy runs into the woods as the sound of gunfire echoes behind him. == Cast == {{Cast listing| * [[Géza Röhrig]] as Saul Ausländer *
